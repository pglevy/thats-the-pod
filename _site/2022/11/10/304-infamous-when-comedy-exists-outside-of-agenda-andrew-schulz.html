<p>Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Schulz discuss the formation of the comedic premise, the necessity and power of play, how self esteem and the internet have helped fuel our modern world and fragmented woke-ness, and why Schulz decided to release his hit special on his own, despite mainstream interest.</p><p> </p><p>Andrew Schulz is an American stand up comic, podcast host, actor, and producer. Schulz began his standup journey in college at the University of California, where he also earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. From there he both hosted and appeared on numerous MTV shows such as Guy Code and The Hook Up. In 2015 Schulz starred in the IFC series Benders, and appeared as a recurring character in Amazon’s Sneaky Pete up until 2017. That same year, he released his first comedy special, 4:1:1, on Youtube. He followed this up in 2018 with the special 5:1:1 which went on to top the charts on Amazon, iTunes, Apple Music, Google Play, and Billboard. He has released multiple comedy EP’s, as well as produced and hosted multiple podcasts, such as The Brilliant Idiots which he co-hosts with Charlamagne tha God, and Flagrant 2 which he shares with fellow comics Akaash Singh, Mark Gagnon, and the video editor known as AlexxMedia. Most recently in 2022, Schulz released yet another free-on-Youtube comedy special, Infamous, which he infamously chose not to release on major streaming platforms, despite express interest.</p><p> </p><p>—Links—</p><p> </p><p>For Andrew Schulz:</p><p> </p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/andrewschulz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p>Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/TheAndrewSchulz</p><p>4:1:1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYvObiM09E4</p><p>5:1:1: https://open.spotify.com/album/6ADcVchw7TBEeANobTDPVQ</p><p>Infamous: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCZkp023MdY</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Sponsors -</p><p> </p><p>Birch Gold: Text "JORDAN" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit</p><p> </p><p>Black Rifle Coffee:</p><p>Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/</p><p> </p><p>Hallow:</p><p>Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>— Chapters —</p><p> </p><p>(0:00) Coming Up</p><p>(0:51) Intro</p><p>(4:00) Saying “no” to the biggest streaming platforms</p><p>(8:00) Fragmented woke-ness</p><p>(11:20) Crenshaw, Kanye, the reactionary right</p><p>(15:00) Andy Ngo, Antifa</p><p>(17:55) Acting for the right reasons versus self preservation</p><p>(21:49) The jokes they wanted to cut</p><p>(24:30) The truth in comedy</p><p>(27:45) Extreme notoriety accompanies success</p><p>(30:58) Why Jordan Peterson has leaned conservative</p><p>(33:15) Self esteem, breaking out, and creativity</p><p>(39:40) Education, the internet, and echo chambers</p><p>(43:55) Resentment, discourse, the Daily Wire</p><p>(47:19) Schulz on Jordan</p><p>(50:55) Finding community online versus in person</p><p>(55:10) Hard arguments and the creation of a comedic premise</p><p>(1:00:45) Curse words are an insight into culture</p><p>(1:02:22) Frustration over censorship, the choice to go it alone</p><p>(1:08:14) The power of story, the lens through which we see the world</p><p>(1:13:31) Why rules are enacted through story</p><p>(1:15:10) Why Hollywood films are more and more disjointed</p><p>(1:21:32) Making fun, the power of play</p><p>(1:25:41) Playing with death, catharsis by fire</p><p>(1:29:19) The collected poetry of Donald Trump</p><p>(1:30:42) Scaling your dragons, when tyrants rule</p><p>(1:33:49) To gaze upon what terrifies us</p><p>(1:41:26) The spirit of play, hard topics, Judaism</p><p>(1:45:50) Kanye, genius, and the hierarchy of cool</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //</p><p>Newsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup</p><p>Donations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate</p><p> </p><p>// COURSES //</p><p>Discovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality</p><p>Self Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com</p><p>Understand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com</p><p> </p><p>// BOOKS //</p><p>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order</p><p>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life</p><p>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning</p><p> </p><p>// LINKS //</p><p>Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com</p><p>Events: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events</p><p>Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog</p><p>Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast</p><p> </p><p>// SOCIAL //</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson</p><p>Instagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson</p><p>Facebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson</p><p>Telegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson</p><p>All socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson</p><p> </p><p>#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus</p>
