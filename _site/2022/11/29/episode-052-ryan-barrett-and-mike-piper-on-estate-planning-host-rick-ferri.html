<p>Proper estate planning is one of the most important elements of a complete financial plan and often the most overlooked. Roughly half of my new clients either have no estate plan or an incomplete plan or an outdated plan. My two guests to discuss the issues are <a href='https://www.ryanbarrettlaw.com/'>Ryan Barrett</a>, a member of both the State Bar of California and Utah State Bar, and <a href='https://michaelrpiper.com/'>Mike Piper, CPA</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ryan is an estate planning attorney who began his legal career in southern California ten years ago after obtaining a Juris Doctor as well as a Master of Business Administration from a concurrent program at Pepperdine Law and Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. Mike is the author of the popular blog “Oblivious Investor” at ObliviousInvestor.com and the creator of the free Open Social Security calculator at OpenSocialSecurity.com. He is also the author of several books on taxes, investing, and Social Security, and now a new book, <a href='https://www.amazon.com/After-Death-Your-Spouse-Financial/dp/1950967123'>After the Death of Your Spouse: Next Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses.</a></p>
<p> </p>
