<p><p>Our guest on the podcast today is Tim Ranzetta. Tim is the co-founder of the nonprofit Next Gen Personal Finance, which provides free curricula, professional development, and advocacy tools to more than 40,000 teachers who reach 75% of high school students in the U.S. The goal of Next Gen Personal Finance and its community of teachers is for all high school students to take at least one stand-alone one-semester course focusing on personal finance by the end of 2030. Prior to founding NGPF, Tim co-founded several companies, including Equilar, a compensation and corporate governance research firm; and Student Lending Analytics, a student loan research firm. He began his career as a management consultant at Bain & Company. He graduated from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor of Science degree in commerce and received his MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-ranzetta-5453a/" target="_blank">Bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.ngpf.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Next Gen Personal Finance</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.eastside.org/_about/board.html" target="_blank">Eastside College Preparatory School</a></p></p><p><p><strong>What Works in Financial Education </strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oj3rM1iEyKfB1uRP5jdIq2s9OIQ6XBEV79vxEGZADHg/edit" target="_blank">Interactive: The Financial Times’ The Uber Game</a></p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27057" target="_blank">Financial Education Affects Financial Knowledge and Downstream Behaviors</a>,” by Tim Kaiser, Annamaria Lusardi, Lukas Menkhoff, and Carly J.
