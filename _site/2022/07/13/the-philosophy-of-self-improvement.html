<p>There are thousands of books, podcasts, and social media posts about how to be more productive, strengthen your relationships, find your purpose, and be your all-around best self. And there are legions of programs and seminars out there designed to help you improve your life. All together, self-help represents a multi-billion dollar industry.</p><p>But despite its ubiquity and cultural influence, you may never have thought about the deeper underpinnings of self-improvement. My guest has. In fact, her research led her to add being a life coach to her academic work as a professor of cultural history, surely creating one of the most unique career combinations. Her name is Anna Schaffner and she's the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3O2mdcP"><i>The Art of Self-Improvement: Ten Timeless Truths</i></a>. Anna and I begin our conversation with how the idea of self-improvement, far from being a recent, Western phenomenon, traces back to antiquity and can be found across cultures. We discuss how self-help reflects what a culture values, and changes based on a culture's conception of selfhood, agency, and the relationship between the individual and society. From there we turn to a few of the timeless principles of self-improvement — self-control, being virtuous, and building positive relationships — looking both at how they were tackled anciently, as well as more modern angles that can also be helpful. We discuss the downside of taking a strictly Stoic approach to life, the idea of making virtue a habit, and how Dale Carnegie can be seen as a modern Machiavelli, in a good way. We end our conversation with Anna's four favorite self-improvement books.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-476-are-modern-people-the-most-exhausted-in-history/" target="_blank">Anna's previous appearance on the show — Episode #476: Are Modern People the Most Exhausted in History?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson-interview/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #377: 12 Rules for Life With Jordan Peterson</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung" target="_blank"><i>Bildung</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-614-get-out-of-your-mind-and-into-your-life/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #614 with Stephen Hayes, founder of Acceptance and Commitment therapy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-746-the-confucian-gentleman/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #746: The Confucian Gentleman</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-148-trying-not-to-try/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #148: Trying Not to Try</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Io0mLJ" target="_blank"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie</a></li><li>Anna's favorite self-improvement books:<ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ItxFNp" target="_blank"><i>Meditation</i>s by Marcus Aurelius</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3nMtgvn" target="_blank"><i>The Happiness Trap</i> by Russ Harris</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Rht0SL" target="_blank"><i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> by Viktor Frankl</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3anr1eU" target="_blank"><i>The Power of Now</i> by Eckhart Tolle</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Connect with Anna Schaffner</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.annakschaffner.com/" target="_blank">Anna's Personal Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.the-exhaustion-coach.com/" target="_blank">Anna's Coaching Website</a></li></ul>
