<p>As men, we all want to be physically capable. We want to be able to save our own life in two ways: in the more metaphorical sense of wanting to preserve it in healthy, fit form for as long as possible, and in the more literal sense of being able to make it through an emergency unscathed. How do you know if you do possess that kind of lifesaving physical capability?</p><p>It’s time to do more than wonder, and really check in with yourself. My guest today has some helpful benchmarks that guys from age 8 to 80 can use to see if they’ve got an operative level of strength, mobility, and conditioning. His name is <a href="http://danjohn.net/">Dan John</a>, and he’s a strength coach and the author of numerous books and articles on health and fitness. Dan walks us through the fitness standards the average male should be able to meet from childhood to old age, beginning with the assessments he gives to those who are 55 years old and older, which includes carrying their body weight, a long jump, and something called “the toilet test.” We then reach back to childhood, and Dan discusses the physical skills kids should become adept in, which were inspired by a turn-of-the-20th-century physical culturist who thought every individual ought to be able to save his own life, and which can be broken down into the categories of pursuit, escape, and attack. We end our conversation with the physical standards those in the 18-55 range should be able to meet, including how much a man should be able to bench press, squat, and deadlift, and the walking test that’s an excellent assessment of your cardiovascular conditioning.</p><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3><ul><li>My <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-exercise-well-rounded-man/">first</a> and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-655-simple-excuse-busting-advice-for-getting-in-shape/">second</a> interview with Dan</li><li><a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/10-things-every-lifter-should-be-able-to-do">10 Things Every Lifter Should Be Able to Do</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/dont-just-lift-heavy-carry-heavy/">Don’t Just Lift Heavy, Carry Heavy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/">Take the Simple Test That Can Predict Your Mortality</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/10-physical-skills-every-man-master/">The 10 Physical Skills Every Man Should Master</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-663-how-to-achieve-physical-autonomy/">How to Achieve Physical Autonomy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-history-of-physical-fitness/">The History of Physical Fitness</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-be-able-to-save-his-own-life-5-fitness-benchmarks-a-man-must-master/">Every Man Should Be Able to Save His Own Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/balance-exercises/">12 Balance Exercises You Can Do on a 2×4</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794BXVY4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0794BXVY4&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">Shaker Plate</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-508-break-out-of-your-cage-and-stop-being-a-human-zoo-animal/">Break Out of Your Cage and Stop Being a Human Zoo Animal</a></li></ul><h3>Connect With Dan</h3><p><a href="https://danjohnuniversity.com/">DanJohnUniversity.com</a> (use code “artofman” for a discount) </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoachDanJohn1?fref=ts">Dan on Facebook</a></p><p><a href="http://danjohn.net/">Dan’s website</a></p><h3><br /> </h3>
