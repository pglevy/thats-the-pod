<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3HLNeOW"><strong>Churchill</strong></a> by Paul Johnson. </p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[2:09] Churchill never allowed mistakes, disaster, illnesses, unpopularity, and criticism to get him down.</p><p>[4:19] <a href="https://amzn.to/31Dt2zg"><strong>The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz</strong></a> by Erik Larson. (Founders #196)</p><p>[4:57] He wrote best-selling biographies on <a href="https://amzn.to/3r3YPC3"><strong>Napoleon</strong></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3HLNeOW"><strong>Churchill</strong></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3qUbebS"><strong>Eisenhower</strong></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3f7HJ0B"><strong>Socrates</strong></a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3zDiGvU"><strong>Mozart</strong></a>.</p><p>[6:39] 3 part series on Larry Ellison: <a href="https://amzn.to/3HR3GNJ"><strong>Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle</strong></a> (Founders #124), <a href="https://amzn.to/3tbi67h"><strong>The Billionaire and the Mechanic: How Larry Ellison and a Car Mechanic Teamed up to Win Sailing's Greatest Race, the Americas Cup, Twice</strong></a> (Founders #126), <a href="https://amzn.to/31G2P3h"><strong>The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison: *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison</strong></a>(Founders #127)</p><p>[7:40] <a href="https://amzn.to/3GmD07a"><strong>How to Get Rich: One of the World's Greatest Entrepreneurs Shares His Secrets</strong></a> by Felix Dennis (Founders #129)</p><p>[8:35] On the importance of belief: I am not asking you to be Winston Churchill. None of us could be. But I do ask that you begin, right now, right at this very moment, to ask yourself whether you believe in yourself. Truly. Do you believe in yourself? Do you? If you do not, and, worse still, if you believe you never can believe, then, by all means, go on reading this book. But take it from me, your only chance of getting rich will come from the lottery or inheritance. If you will not believe in yourself, then why should anyone else?</p><p>[10:15] How did one man do so much, for so long, and so effectively?</p><p>[11:29] Reading is not a chore. Reading is theft. It is a robbery. Someone smarter than you has spent 20 years beating their head against the wall trying to solve the problem you're dealing with. You can steal that hard won knowledge and make it yours. That is power.</p><p>[12:57] <a href="https://amzn.to/3n9GToD"><strong>Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons in Life </strong></a>by Richard Branson (Founders #49)</p><p>[15:27] <a href="https://amzn.to/33jqyGE"><strong>Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela</strong></a></p><p>[16:44] My personal email list: <a href="https://world.hey.com/davidsenra/churchill-8b2053ae"><strong>My top 10 highlights from Churchill</strong></a>.</p><p>[21:51] He had accumulated a number of critics and even enemies, and a reputation for being brash, arrogant, presumptuous, disobedient, boastful, and a bounder.</p><p>[22:22] He thirsted for office, power, and the chance to make history.</p><p>[27:29] Paul Orfalea The educational system teaches kids they have to be good at everything, or else. Out of the classroom, I've found this just isn't so. Adults have a much easier time. They get to specialize. They pick one thing. It's a whole lot easier. <a href="https://amzn.to/3JQESaC"><strong>Copy This!: How I Turned Dyslexia, ADHD, and 100 Square Feet into a Company Called Kinko's</strong></a> (Founders #181)</p><p>[33:34] He is so resourceful and undismayed.</p><p>[35:00]  It's amazing how much of an advantage simply not giving up can give you.</p><p>[37:28] Don’t turn your back on he who will not accept defeat.</p><p>[38:10] <a href="https://amzn.to/31KGUIg"><strong>Big Brown: The Untold Story of UPS</strong></a> (Founders #192)</p><p>[41:09] Really it’s a pretty simple philosophy. What you have to do is just draw a line in the dirt, and force the bureaucracy back behind that line. And then know for sure that a year will go by and it will be back across that line, and you’ll have to do the same thing again. —Sam Walton</p><p>[42:26] Shit happens. Acknowledge it. Learn from it. Forget it. Move on. —Paul Van Duren <a href="https://amzn.to/3qbhRHL"><strong>Authentic: A Memoir by The Founder of Vans</strong></a> (Founders #126) </p><p>[44:00] Churchill was again sent to the bottom and had to face the task of wearily climbing the ladder again, for the third time in his life. It was not so easy now he was nearing fifty.</p><p>[44:35] <a href="https://amzn.to/3zIYB7E"><strong>The World Crisis</strong></a> by Winston Churchill</p><p>[45:01] <a href="https://amzn.to/3q8c1GY"><strong>No More Champagne: Churchill and His Money</strong></a> by David Lough</p><p>[45:40] Churchill had his own version of PEDs: In those days, Churchill often took several whiffs of pure oxygen to lift him before a bout of oratory, and he traveled up with two canisters.</p><p>[47:14] He called for a premium on effort and a penalty on inertia.</p><p>[50:30] You have to work yourself into a position where you can trust your own judgment. That's all you have in life.</p><p>[52:28] Never underestimate your opponent. All downside, no upside.</p><p>[1:02:49] From <a href="https://amzn.to/3t7mJ2o"><strong>Shoe Dog</strong></a>: I looked down the table. Everyone was sinking, slumping forward. I looked at Johnson. He was staring at the papers before him, and there was something in his handsome face, some quality I'd never seen there before. Surrender. Like everyone else in the room, he was giving up. The nation's economy was in the tank, a recession was under way. Gas lines, political gridlock, rising unemployment, Nixon being Nixon-Vietnam. It seemed like the end times. Everyone in the room had already been worrying about how they were going to make the rent, pay the light bill. Now this. I cleared my throat. "So...in other words," I said. I cleared my throat again, pushed aside my yellow legal pad. "What I'm trying to say is, we’ve got them right where we want them."</p><p>[1:08:52] We shall never surrender.</p><p>[1:10:00] Identify your most valuable asset and go all in: What’s going to win this war? Airpower.</p><p>[1:13:10] From <a href="https://amzn.to/3HR6Cdd"><strong>Estee Lauder's autobiography</strong></a>: No community was too small for my attention, my absolutely full efforts. I had ridden, for instance, on a bus for six hours to open a small store in Corpus Christi, Texas. The store's clientele was modest in size and economics. No matter.</p><p>[1:15:22] From <a href="https://amzn.to/3GqiMK9"><strong>Personal History</strong></a>: In one exchange between us, I had deplored the fact that we had the bad luck to live in a world with Hitler, to which Phil responded, “I don’t know. Maybe it’s a privilege to have to fight the biggest son of a bitch in history.”</p><p>[1:16:24] Churchill had an uncanny gift for getting priorities right.</p><p>[1:16:40] He is an apostle of the offensive.</p><p>[1:20:05] Words are the only things that last forever.</p><p>[1:20:23] <a href="https://amzn.to/3f1PHsl"><strong>The Second World War</strong></a> by Winston Churchill</p><p>[1:21:40] Never flinch, never wary, never despair.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
