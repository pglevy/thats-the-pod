<p>In this week’s compilation, we explore the idea of what happens when the religious instinct gets brushed aside – and the things that fill that void instead. Things that, depending on who you ask, may be actively contributing to the breakdown of a society founded on the Abrahamic tradition.</p><p><br /></p><p>Nietzsche has his famous God quote, “God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods, simply to appear worthy of it?”</p><p><br /></p><p>The voices in this compilation may be very familiar since some of them are also featured in the Conceptualization of God series. You’re about to hear from the whole spectrum: through Jonathan Pageau and Matthew Petrusek to Stephen Fry and Lawrence Krauss, just to name a few.</p><p> </p>
