<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3LFOq8s">Mozart: A Life</a> by Paul Johnson.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[1:52] <a href="https://amzn.to/3HLNeOW">Churchill</a> by Paul Johnson (Founders #225)</p><p>[2:15] A life of constant hard work, lived at the highest possible level of creative concentration.</p><p>[3:05] Mozart worked relentlessly.</p><p>[3:56] He started earlier than anyone else and was still composing on his deathbed.</p><p>[5:34] He soon came to the conclusion that he had fathered a genius— and being a highly religious man, that he was responsible for a gift of God to music.</p><p>[7:05] I think the idea here is if you truly believe that what you're doing is good for the world— and you approach it with the same kind of religious zeal— you have a massive advantage over a competitor that doesn't have the same missionary mindset.</p><p>[8:09] <a href="https://amzn.to/32BgAjX">My Turn: A Life of Total Football</a> by Johan Cruyff (Founders #218)</p><p>[8:42] <a href="https://amzn.to/35d6QrK">Leading By Design: The Ikea Story </a>(Founders #104)</p><p>[9:09] He loved humor, and laughter was never far away in Mozart's life, together with beauty—and the unrelenting industry needed to produce it.</p><p>[13:36] <a href="https://amzn.to/3ww6iyc">Decoded</a> by Jay Z (Founders #238)</p><p>[15:36] <a href="https://youtu.be/-4c61A2VD8k">Russ ON: Delusional Self-Confidence & How To Start Manifesting Your Dream Life </a>and <a href="https://youtu.be/nWi6vrvhQ-Y">Steve Stoute & Russ Explain Why Every Creator Should Consider Themselves A Business</a></p><p>[19:46] You don't tell Babe Ruth how to hold a bat.</p><p>[20:43] I will take your demand and I'll use it as a constraint to increase my creativity.</p><p>[21:27] <a href="https://amzn.to/2wIE0jy">The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America's Banana King</a> (Founders #37)</p><p>[22:37] You need to tell potential customers what work and effort goes into the product that you produce because they will have a deeper appreciation for what you do.</p><p>[24:52] <a href="https://amzn.to/3EhdSyq">Inside Steve’s Brain</a> (Founders #204)</p><p>[25:06] He's made and remade Apple in his own image. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives.</p><p>[25:30] Mozart wanted to talk to A players.</p><p>[26:32] <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/01/09/pmarca-blog-ebook/">The Pmarca Blog Archive Ebook</a> by Marc Andreessen (Founders #50)</p><p>[26:57] You should only work in industries where— for the important companies of that industry —the founders are still in charge at those companies.</p><p>[31:13] As a child and teenager Mozart was the most hardworking and productive composer in musical history.</p><p>[34:17] Find something that is being done on a basic level and then realize its potential by re-imagining it.</p><p>[36:13] It was all hard, intense application of huge knowledge and experience, sometimes illuminated by flashes of pure genius.</p><p>[36:40] Imagine being so good at what you do that the ruler of your country has to pass a law to get people to stop clapping.</p><p>[40:15] It is no use asking what if Mozart had had an ordinary, normal father. Mozart without his father is inconceivable, and there is no point in considering it. Just as Mozart himself was a unique phenomenon, so Leopold was a unique father, and the two created each other.</p><p>[41:00] There's a sense in which Mozart's entire life is a gigantic improvisation.</p><p>[41:21] From the age of twenty Mozart never went a month without producing something immortal-something not merely good, but which the musical repertoire would be really impoverished without.</p><p>[43:03] Designing a product is keeping 5,000 things in your brain, and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want. —Steve Jobs</p><p>[43:39] Mozart's beauty prevents one from grasping his power.</p><p>[43:39] <a href="https://amzn.to/2TrgCCN">Sam Walton: The Inside Story of America's Richest Man</a> (Founders #150) and <a href="https://amzn.to/3C3v35B">Sam Walton: Made In America</a> (Founders #234)</p><p>[45:31] Never despair!</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
