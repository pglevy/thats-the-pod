<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3LmBvZy">Risk Game: Self Portrait of an Entrepreneur</a> by Francis Greenburger.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[1:26]  I can be extremely stubborn when I have a hunch about something.</p><p>[3:31] I knew all too well that markets can turn on a dime.</p><p>[5:40] Money that had once flowed freely dried up over night.</p><p>[6:41] I always listened to other people's ideas because that is how you happen upon the good ones.</p><p>[6:46] Logic is no match for bureaucracy.</p><p>[7:33] This ruthless industry has created far more bankruptcies than it has billionaires. Saying no is the most important judgment that you make.</p><p>[9:00] <a href="https://amzn.to/3gI9EFb">Time to Make the Donuts: The Founder of Dunkin Donuts Shares an American Journey</a> (Founders #231)</p><p>[9:09] Sometimes the best lessons that you learn in life are from what you discover in the weaknesses of otherwise very good people.</p><p>[15:54] My father was terrible with money. His knack of mismanaging it, losing it, or not making it in the first place was an incredible source of stress within our family.</p><p>[19:09] The constant question mark that was my parents's checkbook balance made a lasting impression.</p><p>[24:31] His pride in my abilities formed the basis of the self-confidence that allowed me to start businesses, sell books, make crazy friends, and love women at an age when most others were busy with their homework.</p><p>[29:40]  <a href="https://amzn.to/2wIE0jy">The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America's Banana King</a> (Founders #37)</p><p>[30:12] I see opportunity where others saw nothing.</p><p>[31:34] He doesn't dilly-dally. This guy moves fast. It's not like I proved it once, let me try two or three times. He is like it worked once, it's gotta work over and over again, and he immediately starts to scale it.</p><p>[37:40] Don’t interrupt the compounding:  I was skating on razor thin margins that a busted toilet could threaten. But I prefer to remain on the edge as I kept my buildings running rather than sell any of them before they grew to the much higher value that I had a hunch they would one day achieve.</p><p>[40:45] The idea that builds his empire: By co-oping I would be dealing with tens of thousands of dollars in sales, rather than hundreds of dollars in rents.</p><p>[41:58] Once something works don't dilly dally. Go as fast as you possibly can.</p><p>[43:08] Lots of folks thought what I was doing was insane.</p><p>[43:17] I knew something that the market had not yet fully embraced.</p><p>[47:06] My advice to those with expanding businesses is that they must first make a decision about how they want to allocate their time and structure their business so that the balance reflects that.</p><p>[49:33] Children require attention and involvement. This takes you out of your self orientation and makes you invest in another person who can only pay you in one currency: Love.</p><p>[50:09]  If anyone had asked me in 1990 what the chances of my business survival was I would have said 1 in 100. I still consider it a miracle that we didn't go bankrupt.</p><p>[53:12] The main lesson is never delay discomfort. Waiting or ignoring a problem never solves it. Just run towards it.</p><p>[55:36] <a href="https://amzn.to/2Thr3r2">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</a> (Founders #30)</p><p>[56:27] Every parent’s worst nightmare.</p><p>[1:06:25] Disaster usually rises when short-term profit takes precedence over lasting value creation.</p><p>[1:08:21] I don't pick investments. I pick jockeys, not horses.</p><p>[1:10:31] <a href="https://amzn.to/3h1Qat7">Tuxedo Park: A Wall Street Tycoon and The Secret Palace of Science That Changed The Course of World War II</a> (Founders #143)</p><p>[1:10:52] <a href="https://amzn.to/2PKK8lY"><strong>The Richest Woman in America: Hetty Green in the Gilded Age</strong></a> (Founders #103)</p><p>[1:13:52]  Real security comes from adaptability.</p><p>[1:13:59]  Independent thinking in its simplest forms means not assuming that the status quo was the best answer, the right answer, or the most effective answer.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested, so my poor wallet suffers</i>.” — Gareth</p><p>Be like Gareth.
