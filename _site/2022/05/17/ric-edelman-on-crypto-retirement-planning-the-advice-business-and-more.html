<p>Our guest today is Ric Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, or DACFP, an organization he formed in 2018. DACFP aims to advance financial professionals' knowledge of blockchain and digital assets. Prior to forming DACFP, Edelman and his wife Jean founded Edelman Financial Services, which grew to become one of the largest Registered Investment Advisors in the United States before it acquired Financial Engines to form Edelman Financial Engines in 2018. Edelman is a fixture in financial media where he is known for his radio show and frequent print and television appearances and has authored numerous books, including his latest, <i>The Truth About Crypto: A Practical, Easy-to-Understand Guide to Bitcoin, Blockchain, NFTs, and Other Digital Assets</i>. Edelman began his career as a journalist after graduating from Rowan University with a degree in communications.</p><h2>Background</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricedelman/" target="_blank">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://dacfp.com/" target="_blank">Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals</a> (DACFP)</p><p><a href="https://dacfp.com/earn-your-certificate/" target="_blank">DACFP Course on Blockchain and Digital Assets℠</a></p><p><a href="https://www.edelmanfinancialengines.com/" target="_blank">Edelman Financial Engines</a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Truth-About-Crypto-Easy-Understand/dp/1668002329/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TPKQW3ZMVCAL&keywords=ric+edelman+crypto+book&qid=1652728161&s=books&sprefix=Ric+ede%2Cstripbooks%2C106&sr=1-1" target="_blank"><i>The Truth About Crypto: A Practical, Easy-to-Understand Guide to Bitcoin, Blockchain, NFTs, and Other Digital Assets</i></a>, by Ric Edelman</p><p><a href="https://www.thetayf.com/pages/about-ric-edelman">The Truth About Your Future With Ric Edelman</a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ric-Edelman/e/B000APYJPM/ref=sxts_entity_h_bsx_s_def_r00_t_aufl?pd_rd_w=9WHHO&pf_rd_p=7b65f550-ae72-40a7-86e4-c165711b4536&pf_rd_r=7FRKR0RHCVHGB7VKH1QG&pd_rd_r=8b06d5a4-df63-437b-92d6-2c60dcfa2cc1&pd_rd_wg=z1CVl&qid=1652728287&cv_ct_cx=ric+edelman+books" target="_blank">Other books by Ric Edelman</a></p><h2>Cryptocurrency</h2><p>"<a href="https://dacfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ISSUE20_CRYPTO_ATTITUDES-min.pdf" target="_blank">Crypto Attitudes Around the World</a>," by Ric Edelman, dacfp.com, April 25, 2022.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.benefitspro.com/2021/07/02/ric-edelman-expects-the-sec-will-approve-a-bitcoin-etf-412-118160/?slreturn=20220416152923" target="_blank">Ric Edelman Expects the SEC Will Approve a Bitcoin ETF</a>," by Bernice Napach, benefitspro.com, July 2, 2021.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/bitcoin-etf-game-changer-advisors-51634646005" target="_blank">A Bitcoin ETF Could Be a Game-Changer for Advisors.
