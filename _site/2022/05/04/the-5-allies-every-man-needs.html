<p>When it comes to improving our lives and reaching our goals, we often think of changing our personal habits and routines. We think about ourselves, but don’t look outside ourselves. But my guest would say that if we really want to change and make progress, we also need to surround ourselves with positive, strengthening people, and in particular, five types of “allies of glory” who can truly help us be our best.</p><p>His name is Antonio Neves and he’s an author, speaker, podcaster, and success coach. Today on the show, Antonio and I discuss the importance of relationships in moving us forward in our personal and career goals, the difference between allies who facilitate that progress and the thieves who hinder it, and how to minimize the influence that the latter have on us. We then get into the five kinds of allies Antonio says we need in our lives, and he unpacks what each of these allies offers. We end our conversation with Antonio’s advice for how to find these allies and expand your social and professional networks.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/take-responsibility-for-your-life/">Antonio’s previous appearance on the podcast: #676 — Stop Living on Autopilot and Take Responsibility for Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/sunday-firesides-relationships-over-willpower/">Sunday Firesides: Relationships Over Willpower</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/how-to-cut-toxic-people-out-of-your-life/">AoM Article: How to Cut Toxic People Out of Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/handle-difficult-conversations/">AoM Podcast #559: How to Handle Difficult Conversations</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/better-way-to-network/">AoM Podcast #403: A Better Way to Network</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/the-cabinet-of-invisible-counselors/">AoM Article: The Cabinet of Invisible Counselors</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Antonio Neves</h2><ul><li><a href="https://theantonioneves.com/">Antonio’s Website</a></li></ul><h2>Listen to the Podcast!
