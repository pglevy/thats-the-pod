<p>Matthew Dicks wears a lot of hats. Among other things, he's a storyteller, communications consultant, writer, and schoolteacher. In order to excel in his professional life, as well as do what he loves in his personal life, he's developed a set of strategies that help him be more creative and productive, and can be used by anyone who wants to start making the most of life.</p><p>Matt writes about these tactics and mindset shifts in his latest book <a href="https://amzn.to/3QheCc7"><i>Someday Is Today: 22 Simple, Actionable Ways to Propel Your Creative Life</i></a>, and he shares some of them with us today on the show, including why you need to think in minutes, be an eagle rather than a mouse, practice deliberate incuriosity, and always do your best to act like a decent human being. Along the way, Matt and I talk about why you should floss in the shower and how restaurants that make guacamole at your table are a great example of the folly of making a thing, a thing.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/how-to-tell-better-stories/" target="_blank">Matt's previous appearance on the AoM Podcast: Episode #462 — How to Tell Better Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/the-7-habits-begin-with-the-end-in-mind/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The 7 Habits — Begin With the End in Mind</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGqYLMO4aBg" target="_blank">Matthew telling the story of how he was robbed </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/possibilities-spare-moments/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Possibilities in Spare Moments</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Matthew Dicks</h2><ul><li><a href="https://matthewdicks.com/" target="_blank">Matthew’s Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/08/71-E0pzb2iL.jpeg" alt="" /><h2>Listen to the Podcast!
