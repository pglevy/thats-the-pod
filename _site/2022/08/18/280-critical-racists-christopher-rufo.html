<p>Christopher Rufo cast himself into the middle of controversy as he sought to bring light to the inner workings of American academia, and more specifically, how our institutions have begun to funnel in a new and ultimately detrimental worldview, critical race theory. He sits down with Dr. Jordan B Peterson to discuss the subject, delving into the true threat that has breached thousands of publicly funded schools.</p><p>Rufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Before this he was a visiting fellow for domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, as well as a Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute, and a research fellow at the Discovery Institute of Washington. In his early career, he worked in the documentary filmmaking field, where he saw first hand how impoverished communities in the United States operate, and more appropriately continue to struggle under a cycle of seemingly inescapable destitution.</p><p>He is the author of two books, “No Way Home: The Crisis of Homelessness,” and “How to Fix It with Intelligence and Humanity.” Today he publishes a show dedicated to these topics on his YouTube channel, “Christopher Rufo Theory."</p><p>Christopher Rufo's early experiences led him to publicly stand against the rapidly growing movement we see today to teach Critical Race Theory in schools, focusing mainly on K through 12. He argues that CRT looms as “an existential threat to the United States.”</p><p>Watch Christopher Rufo on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/christopherrufo">https://www.youtube.com/c/christopherrufo</a></p><p>Visit the Manhattan Institute: <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/christopher-f-rufo">https://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/christopher-f-rufo</a></p><p>More on Critical Race Theory: <a href="https://christopherrufo.com/crt-briefing-book/">https://christopherrufo.com/crt-briefing-book/</a></p><p>This podcast is sponsored by Birch Gold.
