<p>When we think about people who can live anywhere, we tend to think about corporate-employed remote workers and online entrepreneurs. But many other kinds of professionals, from teachers to doctors, could hypothetically find a job anywhere, and thus live anywhere they’d like.</p><p>If you’re what my guest Melody Warnick calls an “anywhereist” and have seriously or casually considered moving somewhere else, today we’ll talk through the factors to consider in making that decision. Melody is the author of<a href="https://amzn.to/3QMqB1i"><i> If You Could Live Anywhere: The Surprising Importance of Place in a Work-from-Anywhere World</i></a>, and in today’s conversation we discuss the factors that you should include in what she calls a “location strategy,” from the cost of living in a place to whether it allows you to build the kinds of relationships you’re looking for. We also talk about how the place you live can be part of your purpose in life and the elements that contribute to an overall quality of life.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-227-the-art-science-of-loving-the-place-you-live/" target="_blank">Melody‘s previous appearance on the AoM Podcast: Episode #227 — The Art & Science of Loving the Place You Live</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-Where-You-Belong-Wherever-ebook/dp/B016JPTFF0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1660512896&sr=8-3" target="_blank">Melody‘s previous book — <i>This Is Where You Belong: Finding Home Wherever You Are</i></a></li><li><a href="https://tulsaremote.com/" target="_blank">Tulsa’s remote worker program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.makemymove.com/" target="_blank">Make My Move — website which catalogs the various offers cities are making to entice people to move there</a></li><li><a href="https://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/index.html" target="_blank">CNN’s cost of living calculator </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/how-to-make-friends-in-a-new-city/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Make Friends in a New City</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Melody Warnick</h2><ul><li><a href="http://melodywarnick.com/" target="_blank">Melody‘s Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/08/81z59Tm2mTL.jpeg" alt="" width="350" />
