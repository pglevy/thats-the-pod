<p>I've been barbell lifting for seven years. In that time I've hit some personal records that I'm proud of: a 615-lb deadlift, 225 shoulder press, and 465 squat. The last couple years though, I haven't notched these kinds of big milestones for a combination of reasons, including dealing with injuries, having less time, and experiencing a shift in motivation.</p><p>A lot of lifters, as well as amateur athletes of all kinds, will follow a similar trajectory as they move from first starting out to getting deeper into their fitness journey. Here to walk us through the phases of that journey is my own strength coach, Matt Reynolds, who's the founder of <a href="https://store.barbell-logic.com/aom/">Barbell Logic Online Coaching</a>. Matt talks about how the things his lifters focus on change as they move from beginner, to intermediate, to advanced, and why it takes longer to get stronger the longer you've been lifting. We then discuss how to rediscover your motivation for training once progress in your one rep maxes slows down by finding new PRs to chase and learning to enjoy the process over the outcome. We also get into how to stay consistent with your workouts when life gets busier as you get older, as well as how to deal with common injuries — both the injuries themselves and the mental game of working through them.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-154-strength-training-for-everyone/" target="_blank">Matt’s previous appearance on the AoM podcast: Episode #154 — Strength Training for Everyone</a></li><li><a href="https://barbell-logic.com/barbell-logic-podcast-episodes/" target="_blank">The BarbellLogic Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/why-every-man-should-be-strong/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Why Every Man Should Be Strong</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/motivation-over-discipline/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Motivation Over Discipline </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/dealing-with-bicep-tendonitis-a-multi-step-approach/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Treat Bicep Tendonitis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-treat-adductor-tendonitis/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Treat Adductor Tendonitis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/rehab-muscle-strains-tears/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Starr Protocol for Rehabbing Muscle Tears and Strains</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Matt Reynolds</h2><ul><li><a href="https://barbell-logic.com/team/matt-reynolds/" target="_blank">Matt at BarbellLogic</a></li></ul>
