Pericles believed that Athenians were capable of turning their brains and hands to anything of which human ingenuity was capable-running a city and an empire, soldiering, naval warfare, founding a colony, drama, sculpture, painting, music, law, philosophy, poetry, oratory, education, science and do it better than anyone else.</p><p>[16:26] Robber barons like Henry Flagler (Founders #247) and Rockefeller (#248) believed you could be a master of fate too.</p><p>[18:41] <a href="https://amzn.to/3Qkvcbs">Franklin & Washington: The Founding Partnership</a> by Edward Larson.
