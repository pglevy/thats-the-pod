<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3xGNcVi">When Money Was In Fashion: Henry Goldman, Goldman Sachs, and the Founding of Wall Street</a> by June Breton Fisher.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[2:30] <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081208124239/http://www.gladwell.com/2008/2008_11_10_a_adversity.html">The Uses of Adversity</a> by Malcolm Gladwell</p><p>[2:40] <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/99857544/rubinstein-goldman-sachs-fortune-favors-the-old?tab=blocks">Business Breakdowns: Goldman Sachs: Fortune Favors The Old</a></p><p>[3:00]<strong> </strong>Men can learn from the past, and I've been shocked how little some of the younger executives in the present firm know about its origins. They don't even know that my grandfather, whose picture is on the wall there, founded the firm.</p><p>[3:46] My grandfather, Henry Goldman, was the son of a poor German immigrant named Marcus Goldman. Marcus Goldman is the founder of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>[5:45] <a href="https://amzn.to/2nw88ub">Levi Strauss: The Man Who Gave Blue Jeans to the World</a> by Lynn Downey (Founders #33)</p><p>[7:10] The job Marcus Goldman was grateful to have: Walking the streets peddling goods seven days a week. Working regardless of rain, or snow, or the humid summer heat.</p><p>[9:13] Henry had been slow learning to read. It was finally determined that the youngster suffered from astigmatism, and his chores in the shop were limited to fetching and carrying articles from the storeroom or fastening the shutters at closing time. His mother was convinced he would never succeed in a competitive world and was inclined to coddle and baby him. (The “slow learner” is the one that fuels much of Goldman Sachs growth!)</p><p>[12:03] At the time no qualifications or special training were needed to enter the banking business.</p><p>[13:36] Marcus was anxious to capitalize on every waking hour.</p><p>[14:19] Henry was an attentive listener who committed everything he heard to memory.</p><p>[18:40] Successful people listen. Those who don’t listen, don’t survive long. — <a href="https://amzn.to/2XBIDgO">Michael Jordan: The Life</a> by Roland Lazenby (Founders #212)</p><p>[25:12] This part about the Railroads reminded me of the Internet: As new businesses started up every day and the distribution of their goods was being revolutionized by the rapid spider webbing of railroads across the country, Henry was itching to get into the action.</p><p>[26:05] <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/moments/1897-kleinwort.html">Goldman Sachs partners with Kleinwort Sons & Co </a></p><p>[27:36] <a href="https://amzn.to/3sjpRpD">Founder: A Portrait of the First Rothschild </a>by Amos Elon.

(Founders #198)</p><p>[30:01] David Ogilvy’s idea that <strong>The Good Ones Know More</strong>: First, you must be ambitious. Set yourself to becoming the best-informed man in the agency on the account to which you are assigned. If, for example, it is a gasoline account, read text books on the chemistry, geology and distribution of petroleum products. Read all the trade journals in the field. Read all the research reports and marketing plans that your agency has ever written on the product.</p><p>Spend Saturday mornings in service stations, pumping gasoline and talking to motorists. Visit your client's refineries and research  laboratories. Study the advertising of his competitors. At the end of your second year, you will know more about gasoline than your boss; you will then be ready to succeed him. Most of the young men in agencies are too lazy to do this kind of homework. They remain permanently superficial. — <a href="https://amzn.to/30hK7rO"><strong>Confessions of an Advertising Man</strong></a> by David Ogilvy.

(Founders #145)</p><p>[54:00] But he held no sympathy for them. <strong>They had relied on the decisions of others, which he himself would never have done.</strong></p><p>[54:13] Henry shared the regret that he had never developed greater rapport with his children. He thought of his inability to “noodle" with them, to express approval, to overlook their minor slips, to embrace them and say, “I love you.”</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
