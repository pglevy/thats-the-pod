<p>In this week’s episode, we’re chatting to Joe Wiggins. Joe is the CIO of Fundhouse, a provider of manager research, model portfolios, and ESG services to clients ranging from charities, pension funds, wealth managers, and select financial advisors. Joe is here today because he has written a rather useful book about fund investing, but he is also a decision-maker in his own right at Fundhouse. We’re excited to get his view on the world of investing, too.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/about-me/">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fundhouse.co.uk/about-us/who-we-are/">Fundhouse</a></p><p><a href="https://www.harriman-house.com/intelligentfundinvestor"><i>The Intelligent Fund Investor</i></a>, by Joe Wiggins</p><p><a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/author/joeywig/"><i>Behavioural Investment</i></a> Blog</p><p>Financial Decision-Making</p><p>“<a href="https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/six-simple-steps-to-improve-decision-making">Six Simple Steps to Improve Decision Making</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://livewiremarkets.com/" target="_blank">livewiremarkets.com</a>, March 14, 2019.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2022/12/06/three-questions-to-answer-before-investing-in-an-active-fund/">Three Questions to Answer Before Investing in an Active Fund</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, Dec. 6, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.abrdn.com/en/capgemini/insights-thinking-aloud/article-page/a-behavioural-finance-toolkit">A Behavioural Finance Toolkit</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://abrdn.com/" target="_blank">abrdn.com</a>, March 5, 2019.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2021/11/23/betting-against-warren-buffett/">Betting Against Warren Buffet</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, Nov. 23, 2021.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2022/09/20/learning-to-be-a-good-investor-is-hard/">Learning How to Be a Good Investor Is Hard</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, Sept. 20, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2022/09/30/the-behavioural-lessons-of-gilt-market-turmoil/">The Behavioural of Gilt Market Turmoil</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, Sept. 30, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2022/03/08/why-cant-we-stop-making-short-term-market-forecasts/">Why Can’t We Stop Making Short-Term Market Forecasts?</a>” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, March 8, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2021/05/06/why-do-fund-investors-neglect-base-rates/">Why Do Fund Investors Neglect Base Rates?</a>” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, May 6, 2021.</p><p>Star Fund Managers</p><p>“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f077ae2-f19e-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">Neil Woodford: The Inside Story of his Rise and Dramatic Fall</a>,” by Owen Walker and Peter Smith, <a href="http://ft.com/" target="_blank">ft.com</a>, Oct. 18, 2019.</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2020/10/27/what-is-the-attraction-of-star-fund-managers/">What Is the Attraction of Star Fund Managers?</a>” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, Oct. 27, 2020.</p><p>Risks</p><p>“<a href="https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2022/07/19/how-to-identify-behavioural-investment-opportunities-and-risks/">How to Identify Behavioural Investment Opportunities and Risks</a>,” by Joe Wiggins, <a href="http://behaviouralinvestment.com/" target="_blank">behaviouralinvestment.com</a>, July 19, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/229672/investors-are-still-scared-of-funds.aspx">Investors Are Still Scare of Funds</a>,” by Sunniva Kolostyak, <a href="http://morningstar.co.uk/" target="_blank">Morningstar.co.uk</a>, Nov. 29, 2022.</p><p>Book Recommendations</p><p><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Against+the+Gods:+The+Remarkable+Story+of+Risk-p-9780471295631"><i>Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk</i></a><i>,</i> by Peter Bernstein</p><p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/war-and-chance-assessing-uncertainty-in-international-politics-by-jeffrey-a-friedman-new-york-oxford-university-press-2019-240p-3495-cloth/C0E783A33648077C81EADBEB31EC89EA"><i>War and Chance: Assessing Uncertainty in International Politics</i></a><i>,</i> by Jeffrey A.
