<p>Ben Thompson joins Acquired to discuss the business of Stratechery itself and celebrate 10 years (!) of the internet’s best strategy analysis destination. Even beyond Stratechery’s enormous impact itself on business and tech over the years, Ben’s work inspired a whole generation of business content creators — this show very much included — and it was super special for us to give the Acquired treatment to one of our own heroes. We cover the full history of Ben pioneering the subscription internet media business model (indeed SubStack’s seed round pitch was “Stratechery-in-a-box”), and how + why he’s evolved the business since and is now doubling down both on podcasting and a broader vision of the Stratechery Plus bundle… including for the first time content not made by Ben himself! Tune in and enjoy. </p><p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!). <br></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Links:</p><ul><li>John Gruber’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a></li><li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">Ben’s very first Stratechery post</a></li><li>Subscribe to <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery Plus</a></li></ul><p><em>‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
