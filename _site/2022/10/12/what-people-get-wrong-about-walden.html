<p>The two years, two months, and two days Henry David Thoreau spent at Walden Pond represent one of the most well-known experiences in American literary and philosophical history. Thoreau's time at Walden has become something of a legend, one that is alternately lionized and criticized.</p><p>Yet though many people know of Thoreau's experience at Walden, and the book he wrote about it, far fewer really understand its whys, whats, and hows.</p><p>My guest, who's dedicated his career to studying Thoreau, will unpack the oft-missed nuances and common misconceptions about Walden. His name is Jeffrey S. Cramer, and he's the Curator of Collections at The Walden Woods Project, as well as the author and editor of numerous books about Thoreau, including <a href="https://www.walden.org/product/annotated-walden/"><i>Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition</i></a>. Today on the show, Jeffrey explains the reason Thoreau went to Walden, which wasn't originally to write about that experience, and which ended up evolving over time. We discuss what Walden Pond was like, the dimensions and furnishings of the house Thoreau built on its shores, and how he spent his days there. Jeffrey explains why Thoreau left Walden, how he was less attached to the experience than we commonly assume, and how the significance of the experience came less from living it and more from writing about it. We then discuss how <i>Walden</i> the book became a classic despite an initially slow start, before turning to what Jeffrey thinks of the common criticisms of it, and the popular impulse to tear Thoreau down. We end our conversation with what we moderns can learn from Thoreau's experiment with living deliberately.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/really-avoid-living-life-quiet-desperation/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to REALLY Avoid Living a Life of Quiet Desperation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/the-libraries-of-famous-men-henry-david-thoreau/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Libraries of Famous Men — Henry David Thoreau</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-417-expect-great-things-the-mystical-life-of-henry-david-thoreau/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #417: Expect Great Things — The Mystical Life of Henry David Thoreau</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/transcendentalists-their-world-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #779: The World of the Transcendentalists and the Rise of Modern Individualism</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/sunday-firesides-every-man-needs-his-own-waldens/" target="_blank">Sunday Firesides: Every Man Needs His Own Walden(s)</a></li><li>Thoreau's works mentioned in the show:<ul><li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/205" target="_blank"><i>Walden</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4232" target="_blank"><i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42500/42500-h/42500-h.htm" target="_blank"><i>The Maine Woods</i></a></li><li><a href="https://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/thoreau/civil.html" target="_blank"><i>Civil Disobedience </i></a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Exk8oh" target="_blank">Jeffrey's <i>Solid Seasons: The Friendship of Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum" target="_blank">Kathryn Schulz's critical article on Thoreau</a> and <a href="https://classicpenguin.tumblr.com/post/133929885889/in-the-october-19-issue-of-the-new-yorker-kathryn" target="_blank">Jeffrey's response to it</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Jeffrey S.
