<p>This episode is focused on international stock market index funds and ETFs. My two guests are Christine Franquin, a principal and senior portfolio manager in the Vanguard Equity Index Group, and Michael Perre, also a principal in the Vanguard Equity Index Group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christine manages several equity and balanced funds, including funds for U.S. and international investors as well as indexed separate accounts, and Michael oversees the portfolio management of Vanguard’s internally managed equity index funds. He is involved with the daily trading and portfolio management of those funds.</p>
