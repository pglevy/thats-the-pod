<p><p>Our guest on the podcast today is David John. David is a senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP Public Policy Institute, where he works on pension and retirement savings issues. He also serves as deputy director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution. RSP focuses on improving retirement savings in the United States, especially among moderate and low-income workers. Before joining AARP, David was a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. He also has extensive public policy experience working for a money center bank, a law firm, a credit union trade association, and four members of the House of Representatives. David has written and spoken extensively about the importance of reforming the nation's retirement programs. He is co-author with J. Mark Iwry of the Automatic IRA, a small business retirement savings program for firms that do not sponsor any other form of retirement savings or pension plan. In addition, David is one of four co-editors of the 2009 book <em>Automatic: Changing the Way America Saves</em>. David holds an ABJ in journalism, an M.A. in economics, and an MBA in finance—all from the University of Georgia.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.aarp.org/ppi/info-2017/david-john.html#:~:text=Profile-,David%20C.,RSP)%20at%20the%20Brookings%20Institution." target="_blank">Bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Changing-Way-America-Saves/dp/0815702787/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TO1FSQX2A0BU&keywords=Automatic%3A+Changing+the+Way+America+Saves&qid=1664230599&sprefix=automatic+changing+the+way+america+saves%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Automatic: Changing the Way America Saves</em></a>, by William G.
