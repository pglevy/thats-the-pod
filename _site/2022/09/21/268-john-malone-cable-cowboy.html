<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3R2D4h2">Cable Cowboy: John Malone and the Rise of the Modern Cable Business</a> by Mark Robichaux.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>Outline:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/loadlinefinance/status/1018936754852597761?s=20&t=6KhqWY1NrVBhIgfXLts-lQ">Thread of highlights from Cable Cowboy</a> by @Loadlinefinance</p><p>Malone was stalwart about building long term value through leveraged cash flow. Earnings didn’t count. He wasn’t constrained by quarterly expectations.</p><p>Malone built the pipes, then bought the water that flows through them.</p><p>Malone took spartan operations to another level. Absolutely no bureaucracy. No waste. We don’t believe in staff. Staff are people who second-guess people.</p><p>Malone averaged one M&A deal every two weeks over 15 years. That’s insane. These guys were slinging billion dollar deals like bowls of breakfast cereal.</p><p>One of the best parts of the book is Robichaux’s exploration of Malone’s complex personality. It’s not just a fawning glow piece.</p><p>The beginning of industries are always filled with cowboys, pirates, and misfits.</p><p>This book— by far — has been the most requested book for me to cover on Founders for years.</p><p>Founders episodes on Andrew Carnegie:</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2QmW3oU">Meet You In Hell: Andrew Carnegie Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America</a> by Les Standiford.

Jay Gould saw the importance of the telegraph industry in part because telegraph lines were laid next to railraod tracks.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3xr8SFA">Edison: A Biography</a> by Matthew Josephson (Founders #267)</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3B3GP1t">Dark Genius of Wall Street: The Misunderstood Life of Jay Gould, King of the Robber Barons</a> by Edward J.
