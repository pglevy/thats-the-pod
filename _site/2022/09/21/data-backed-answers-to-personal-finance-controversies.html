<p>Dip your toes into the world of personal finance and you can find plenty of questions which are the subject of endless debate. How much of your income should you save? Is it okay to take on debt? Which is better — renting a home or owning one? When it comes to the stock market, should you buy the dip?</p><p>On his blog, Of Dollars and Data, my guest cuts through the personal finance noise by finding answers based on numbers rather than conjecture, and then converting this research into advice the average person can understand. His name is Nick Maggiulli, and he's the Chief Operating Officer and Data Scientist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3BqjbuE"><i>Just Keep Buying: Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your Wealth</i></a>. Today on the show, Nick explains what the data says about how you should approach the questions I've already mentioned. He also shares how to spend your money without feeling guilty by using the "2X Rule," the three criteria you should meet before you consider buying a home, the best way to approach the idea of "dollar cost averaging," and more. We end our conversation with the right mindset to adopt in our volatile economy.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3BO7VcZ" target="_blank"><i>Your Money or Your Life</i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3BoImxD" target="_blank"><i>The Value of Debt in Building Wealth</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/index-funds-for-beginners/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Index Funds For Beginners</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/ramit-sethi-interview-rich-life/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #536: How to Achieve a “Rich Life” With Your Finances</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Nick Maggiulli</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/" target="_blank">Nick's blog: Of Dollars and Data</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dollarsanddata" target="_blank">Nick on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickmaggiulli/?hl=en" target="_blank">Nick on IG</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/09/81JC-3KbNSL.jpeg" alt="" />
