<p>Pizza. It's ubiquitous. It's a fixture at parties and office break rooms, and there's a good chance you order it from your favorite place for dinner every single week.</p><p>But there's one setting where pizza doesn't show up very often, and that's in your own oven, having been made in your own kitchen. But my guest today, who's spent decades pursuing the perfect pizza, says you ought to be making your own pies more often and will teach you the secrets to getting restaurant-quality pizza at home. His name is Dan Richer, and he's the owner and chef of Razza in New Jersey, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/34qRWUa"><i>The Joy of Pizza: Everything You Need to Know</i></a>.</p><p>We begin our conversation with what makes pizza such an awesome, go-to, inexhaustibly delicious dish and how to overcome the obstacles that typically prevent people from creating pizzeria-level pizza at home. Dan then gives us his recommendations on sauce, cheese, and toppings in order to create the perfect pizza pie, including his take on that most burning of questions: does pineapple belong on a pizza?</p><h2>Connect With Dan Richer</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.thejoyofpizzabook.com/"><i>Joy of Pizza</i> Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/danricher/?hl=en">Dan on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://razzanj.com/">Website for Dan's Razza restaurant</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/03/91nY5490oL.jpeg" alt="" /><h2>Â </h2>
