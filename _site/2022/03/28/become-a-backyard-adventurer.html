<p>A lot of people feel like they've seen and done everything there is to see and do in their local area. They're bored of their daily routine, and contemplate going off on some grand adventure in a exotic locale.</p><p>My guest would say that you don't actually have to wait until your next big trip nor go far afield to mix things up, and that adventure can be found right where you are, in your ordinary routines, the everyday landscape of your life, and even DIY projects, if you decide to approach them in a different way.</p><p>His name is Beau Miles and he's an Australian filmmaker who documents his own small-scale adventures on YouTube, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3uBjpM8"><i>The Backyard Adventurer</i></a>. Today on the show, Beau shares his experiments in proving anything can be infused with the challenge, intrigue, and fun which mark adventure, if you add in some intentional risk, difficulty, and simple what-the-heck quirkiness. He tells us about some of the close-to-home adventures he's executed, including walking and kayaking his 90-kilometer commute to work, reconnecting an old, long closed-down rail line by running its often hidden, overgrown path with a shovel in his hand, and making a paddle with scavenged wood. We then talk about how he created a gastronomical adventure for himself by eating his body weight in beans, and even turned tackling his to-do list into an adventure by pairing the crossing off of its entries with running a marathon in 24 hours. Along the way, Beau shares how backyard adventures help you better get to know your local area, how he deals with the police who sometimes check in on what he's up to, and how the next time you get some odd idea, you ought to just go for it, mate.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Beau's films/adventures mentioned in the show:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Zyud8xh2c">Walking to Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysgH_rkfGSE">Paddling to Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqZJ01sNQuw">Junk Paddle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYsTlfhDSDY">Human Bean</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxCghemtjjM">Run the Line</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvT5XS7j-Dc">Mile an Hour</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/my-8-week-microadventure-challenge/">AoM Article: My 8-Week Microadventure Challenge</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/podcast-120-microadventures-with-alastair-humphreys/">AoM Podcast #120: Microadventures With Alastair Humphreys</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/benefits-of-walking/">AoM Podcast #560: The Magic of Walking</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3iiJ9XJ"><i>Tortilla Flat</i> by John Steinbeck</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Beau Miles</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://beaumiles.com/" target="_blank">Beau's Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm325cMiw9B15xl22_gr6Dw" target="_blank">Beau on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/beauisms/?hl=en" target="_blank">Beau on Instagram</a></li></ul>
