<p>As the dying approach their death, up to 88% of them experience certain vivid, moving dreams — though "dreams" isn't even the best word for these experiences, as they can happen to people when they're both awake and asleep, and are described by them as being "more real than real."</p><p>My guest today has studied these visions and dreams for many years and thinks they have important insights into the nature of life and death. His name is Dr. Chrisopther Kerr, and he's a hospice physician and end-of-life researcher, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3MKoh9U"><i>Death Is But a Dream: Finding Hope and Meaning at Life's End</i></a>. We begin our conversation with Dr. Kerr's efforts to study end-of-life experiences on an objective, scientific basis, and how his research into these visions and dreams doesn't attempt to find their spiritual or paranormal origin, but simply seeks to catalog the phenomenon from a clinical perspective. We then discuss how long before death people begin having these dreams, the content of the dreams, and who shows up in them. Dr. Kerr describes how pre-death visions and dreams are typically positive and comforting, and how even the rarer, disturbing variety can end up being transformative. And he shares what these dreams do not only for the dying, but for their caregivers as well.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.drchristopherkerr.com/">Dr. Kerr's Tedx Talk</a></li><li><a href="https://pbsinternational.org/programs/death-is-but-a-dream/"><i>Death Is But a Dream</i> PBS documentary</a></li><li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80998853">Netflix docuseries <i>Surviving Death</i> (Dr. Kerr is featured on the 5th episode)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/podcast-171-the-dying-experience-myths-and-answers/">AoM Podcast #171: The Dying Experience — Myths and Answers</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/03/81CcwD0GLTL.jpeg" alt="" /><h2>Connect With Dr. Kerr</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.drchristopherkerr.com/">Dr. Kerr's Website</a></li></ul>
