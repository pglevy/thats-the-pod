<p>Many of us want to learn a new skill or master a new area of expertise, either to further or change our career or simply for the sake of personal fulfillment. But going deep in a subject seems like it would take a long time, and even require going back to school, something most of us don't have the time, money, and desire to do.</p><p>My guest today says there's another way. His name is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/" target="_blank">Scott Young</a> and he's the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K6MF8MD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07K6MF8MD&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career</em></a>. We begin our conversation with Scott's successful experiment of doing all the course work for a computer science degree from MIT in less than a year and for free and how this opened Scott up to the idea of "ultralearning." We then discuss the economic benefits of learning how to learn, as well as the personal benefits that come from mastering new skills as adults. In the second half of our conversation, we get into the practical techniques of the ultralearning method, including creating a plan for your learning project, choosing active over passive learning, and drilling effectively. Scott and I end our discussion with how to figure out what feedback to listen to and what to ignore as you're learning a new project. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/ultralearning" target="_blank">aom.is/ultralearning</a>.</p>
