<p>Our ancestors were able to navigate long distances, find water, and even predict the weather simply by looking at their environment. My guest today says we still have this nature instinct inside of us and with a little practice, we can revive it. </p><p>His name is <a href="https://www.naturalnavigator.com/tristan-gooley/" target="_blank">Tristan Gooley</a>, he's an outdoorsman and author, and his latest book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1615195912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1615195912&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Nature Instinct: Learn to Find Direction, Sense Danger, and Even Guess Nature’s Next Move—Faster Than Thought</em></a>. Today on the show we discuss how humans have the ability to simply look at something in nature and immediately see direction, time, or weather conditions. While modern humans have lost this ability, Tristan makes the case that with some practice, anyone can re-learn it. We then discuss how learning how to read nature intuitively makes us more engaged with our surroundings and able to see more significance in our environment. Tristan then shares signs to look for in nature to anticipate animal behavior, find water, and predict the weather. After listening to this show, you'll never look at squirrels the same way.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/natureinstinct" target="_blank">aom.is/natureinstinct</a>.</p>
