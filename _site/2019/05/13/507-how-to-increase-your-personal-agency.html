<p>Many people today are feeling stressed or overwhelmed by life. The typical approach to treating these issues is to learn how to manage one's symptoms through things like mindfulness or meditation. My guest today argues that mere management is insufficient. Instead, we need to tackle the root of what’s causing us to feel anxious, stuck, and generally lost—a decreasing sense of agency. </p><p>His name is <a href="http://performpsych.com/about.php" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Napper</a> and he’s a psychologist and the co-author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250127572/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1250127572&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Power of Agency: The 7 Principles to Conquer Obstacles, Make Effective Decisions, and Create a Life on Your Own Terms</em></a>. Today on the show, Paul makes the case that the reason more and more people feel like they're floundering, is that they don't have a strong sense of personal agency. Paul explains what he means by agency, and why learning how to get better at thinking, acting, and making choices for yourself can be the real key to feeling less stuck in life. Paul and I then discuss the seven overarching principles of increasing your agency, as well tactics to put them into practice.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/agency" target="_blank">aom.is/agency</a>.</p>
