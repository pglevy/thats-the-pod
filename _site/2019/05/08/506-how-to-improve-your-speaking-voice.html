<p>When it comes to your personal presentation, there’s one aspect that often gets overlooked: your voice. </p><p>Your voice is a big part of what makes you, you, and what makes you likable and influential. Yet you probably don't think too much about it. </p><p>Not to mention, my guest today argues, you’re likely not even using your true voice thanks to bad habits you’ve picked up throughout your life. </p><p>His name is <a href="http://rogerlove.com" target="_blank">Roger Love</a>, he’s a voice coach who's worked with some of the world's most famous singers and speakers, and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031631126X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=031631126X&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Set Your Voice Free</em></a>. Today on the show, Roger explains why having a clear, confident, pleasant speaking voice is important for success in your career and your life, the the biggest ways people sabotage their voice, including voice fry, uptalk, and being nasally, and how these issues can be addressed and eliminated. Roger also shares how to speak in a more masculine way, and why you're probably not speaking loudly enough. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/voice" target="_blank">aom.is/voice</a>.</p>
