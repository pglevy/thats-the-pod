<p>Have you ever walked into a room to get something, only to forget why you walked into that room in the first place? Do you constantly forget where you parked your car in a parking garage? Or have trouble remembering people's names?</p><p>After today's episode, you'll be well on your way to never forgetting these things again because my guest is champion memory athlete <a href="http://nelsondellis.com" target="_blank">Nelson Dellis</a> and he's got plenty of advice on how to improve your own memory, even if you think yours stinks. Nelson is the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419732560/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1419732560&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Remember It!</em></a>, and we begin our show discussing the world of memory competitions, how Nelson got involved with them, and what records he's notched so far. Nelson then corrects a couple common myths people have about memory and makes the case for why you ought to care about improving your own. He shares the overarching system he recommends to improve your ability to retain information, and how to use it to remember where you parked, people's names, and the items on your to-do list. Nelson also explains the reason we forget what we walked into a certain room to get, and what to do if that happens to you. He then walks us through how walking through a "memory palace" can help you remember lists, speeches, and more.  </p><p>Plenty of action-ready, easy-to-remember tips in this show.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/rememberit" target="_blank">aom.is/rememberit</a>.</p>
