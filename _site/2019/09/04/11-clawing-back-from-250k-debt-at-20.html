Aleks Svetski (@AleksSvetski) wanted to be a millionaire by 20... and he was on that path. He turned his $5K textbook money into more than $50,000 in the stock market! Until the 2008 global financial crisis hit... he didn't just lose all his money, he was negative quarter of a million. This setback ignited his entrepreneurial spirit where he started a door knocking hustle to get out his debt and make that cool million. Again, until the government betrayed his business and he went back to square one becoming a hippie on a sabbatical... and now he's back again with the lessons he's learned with his newfound passion: Bitcoin.Â
