<p>Like FDR or JFK, Ronald Reagan has become more of a symbol for many Americans than a flesh and blood person. For some he’s the embodiment of all that’s good in America, while for others he's the very opposite. But beyond the political divides, who was Reagan, the man?</p><p>My guest today spent five years researching and writing an epic, non-partisan biography that seeks to bring the abstraction of Reagan back down to earth. His name is <a href="http://bobspitz.com" target="_blank">Bob Spitz</a> and his biography is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594205310/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594205310&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Reagan: An American Journey</em></a>. </p><p>We begin our conversation discussing how Reagan’s hardscrabble childhood in the Midwest and his family’s staunch progressive politics influenced his early political outlook. Bob then shares how a young Ronald Reagan showed signs of becoming "the Great Communicator" as a young man and how his charm and innate talent for speaking led to a successful career in radio and the movies. </p><p>We then discuss why Reagan went from being a true believing Democratic New Dealer to being a leader in the burgeoning conservative movement in the 1960s. Bob delves into Reagan’s leadership style as governor of California and President of the United States and the important role Nancy Reagan played throughout his political career. </p><p>We end our conversation discussing Reagan’s ultimate legacy.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/ronaldreagan" target="_blank">aom.is/ronaldreagan</a>.</p>
