<p>There's no doubt that luck plays a role in how successful we are in life, but the more we believe in luck, the less motivated we feel to proactively go after our goals. How do we navigate this paradox around luck â€” acknowledging the influence of chance but not letting it demoralize us?</p><p>My guest today argues the answer lies in seeing life more like playing a game of poker than pulling the handle of a slot machine. Her name is <a href="http://kstarr.com" target="_blank">Karla Starr</a> and she's the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846862/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591846862&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Can You Learn to Be Lucky? Why Some People Seem to Win More Often Than Others</em></a>.</p><p>Today on the show Karla argues that no matter what hand you're dealt in life, there are still many things you have control over that you can influence to make your own "luck." We talk about how the things that come down to chance, like the timing of a job interview, how physically attractive you are, and whether you have more or less resilient genes can be influenced or counteracted by our own proactive behaviors so that more opportunities in life fall our way.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/lucky" target="_blank">aom.is/lucky</a>.</p>
