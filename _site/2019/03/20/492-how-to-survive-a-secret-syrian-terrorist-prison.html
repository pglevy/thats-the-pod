<p>Matthew Schrier was on his way home from Syria after spending months photographing the war going on there, when, just 45 minutes from the safety of the Turkish border, he was taken prisoner by the Al-Nusra Front â€” a branch of Al-Qaeda in Syria.</p><p>For the next seven months he was starved and tortured in six different prison camps. Yet he survived, becoming the first Westerner to escape Al-Qaeda. Today he teaches the military about what he learned through his experience.</p><p>Today on the show, I talk to Matt about his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1944648887/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1944648887&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Dawn Prayer</em></a>, which details what he learned about how to survive a Syrian prison, as well the lessons he learned in what <em>not</em> to do from a fellow American with whom he was held captive.</p><p>Get the snow notes at <a href="http://aom.is/dawnprayer" target="_blank">aom.is/dawnprayer</a>.</p>
