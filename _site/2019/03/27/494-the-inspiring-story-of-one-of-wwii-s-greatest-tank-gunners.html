<p>Recently, I participated in the AoM podcast's first live audience interview. It took place at <a href="https://www.magiccitybooks.com/" target="_blank">Magic City Books</a> here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and joining me for the interview was two-time past guest <a href="https://www.adammakos.com/" target="_blank">Adam Makos</a>. Makos, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095ZQ36G/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=IUOrxOzERspHJb3yB7GgmQ&slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0095ZQ36G&linkCode=w61&tag=stucosuccess-20&linkId=YUDWNAWRAVQALY5Q" target="_blank"><em>A Higher Call</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804176582/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=z39-xiWni5lc.J.8Q9Jyvg&slotNum=1&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804176582&linkCode=w61&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Devotion</em></a>, was here in T-Town to discuss his most recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804176728/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804176728&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Spearhead: An American Tank Gunner, His Enemy, and a Collision of Lives in World War II</em></a>.</p><p><em>Spearhead</em> follows the story of Clarence Smoyer -- a quiet kid from Pennsylvania coal country who became one of the greatest tank gunners in World War II history -- and how his life crossed paths with an enemy tanker, Gustav Schaefer, during the Battle of Cologne. Adam shares how he became interested in WWII history as a kid and how he found Clarence's story. He then gives us an engaging rundown of tank warfare in WWII, and walks us through Clarence’s hero’s journey and the epic battles he faced with calm commitment and a love for his team of tankers. We end our conversation discussing what happened when Clarence and Gustav recently met up as old men, and the lessons Adam thinks members of the social media age can take from the veterans of the Big One.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/spearhead" target="_blank">aom.is/spearhead</a>.</p>
