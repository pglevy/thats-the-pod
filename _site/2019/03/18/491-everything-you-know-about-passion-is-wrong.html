<p>"Passion" is a word that's been thrown around a lot in the last few decades. People have a vague notion that passion is a very good thing, and that they want to find it in their work and lives. But beyond passion as a buzzword, its realities are actually very little discussed and seldomly well understood.</p><p>My guests today have set out to correct this deficit in their new book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1635653436/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1635653436&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Passion Paradox: A Guide to Going All In, Finding Success, and Discovering the Benefits of an Unbalanced Life</em></a>. Their names are Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness, and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-350-using-stress-recovery-adaptation-cycle-get-better-work/" target="_blank">I had them on the show last year</a> to discuss their book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/162336793X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=162336793X&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Peak Performance</em></a>. Today, we talk about the parts of passion that rarely get talked about: that it has both a positive and a negative side, how the advice to “find your passion” isn’t very useful, and the 3 things you need to really grow your passion. We also discuss why going all-in on your passion too early can lead to long-term failure, how passion can lead individuals to cheat to get and stay ahead, and why embracing the 6 pillars of the "mastery mindset" can help negate the negative side of passion, and harness its positive powers. We end our conversation discussing how it's okay to have an unbalanced life, and what to do if you can no longer do the thing you’re passionate about or you simply stop being passionate about your work.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/passionparadox" target="_blank">aom.is/passionparadox</a>.</p>
