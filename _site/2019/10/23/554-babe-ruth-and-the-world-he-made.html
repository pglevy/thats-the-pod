<p>The Sultan of Swat. The Colossus of Clout. The King of Crash. The Great Bambino. </p><p>Babe Ruth died over 70 years ago, but his legend still lives on in big league stadiums and little league fields across America. While we know a lot about Ruth's baseball career, little was known about his early life and how it shaped him to become America's first superstar athlete and celebrity. My guest today sought to remedy that in her recently published biography: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075WTRYMC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B075WTRYMC&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Big Fella: Babe Ruth and the World He Created</em></a>. Her name is <a href="https://www.janeleavy.com/" target="_blank">Jane Leavy</a>, and she's a former sports journalist and the author of two other biographies of baseball greats. We begin our conversation discussing Ruth's sad and difficult childhood in a Baltimore boarding school and how he learned to play baseball from the Xaverian brothers who ran it. We then shift to how Ruth's hunger for affirmation helped him become the country's first real celebrity, and how his baseball career coincided with the burgeoning fields of public relations and technology, ushering in a new era in sports writing, endorsements, and entertainment. We end our conversation discussing Ruth's legacy in the world, and business, of professional sports. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/ruth" target="_blank">aom.is/ruth</a>.</p>
