<p>Whether sitting next to someone on the subway, mingling at a wedding, or chatting around the water cooler, chances to make conversation and new friends abound in our lives. But how do you meet and talk to people without being awkward about it?</p><p>My guest today has spent over three decades teaching people from all walks of life how to make small talk and socialize. His name is <a href="http://www.dongabor.com/" target="_blank">Don Gabor</a>, and he's the author of several books, including the one we're talking about today, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451610998/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451610998&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>How to Start a Conversation and Make Friends</em></a>. </p><p>We begin our conversation discussing where Don sees people have the most problems with starting and sustaining conversations, as well as whether these issues have or haven't changed over the last thirty years. Don then walks us through how you can make yourself more approachable for small talk, why body language is so key in this area, and the best way to give a handshake. We then discuss how to break the ice with someone you've just made contact with, how to handle rejection, and how to remember people's names after you meet them. Don then shares how to keep the conversation going by offering up and homing in on certain keywords. We end our conversation, with how to end a conversation. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/conversation" target="_blank">aom.is/conversation</a>.</p>
