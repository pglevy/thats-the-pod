<p>In the past few years, sports recovery has become a big business. Elite athletes and weekend warriors alike are spending lots of time and money on things like cryotherapy, float tanks, foam rolling, and supplements in order to feel better, push themselves harder, and gain an edge over the competition. But does any of this stuff actually do anything? </p><p>My guest today spent a year investigating the science of exercise recovery. Her name is <a href="https://christieaschwanden.com/" target="_blank">Christie Aschwanden</a> and she’s the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039325433X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=039325433X&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Good to Go: What the Athlete in All of Us Can Learn From the Strange Science of Recovery</em></a>. We begin our show discussing what exactly athletic “recovery” is and why the recovery business has been booming recently. Christie and I then dig into several different recovery modalities from drinking Gatorade, to taking ice baths, to foam rolling, and the science, or the lack thereof, behind their effectiveness. We end our conversation discussing what actually works best for exercise recovery (hint: you do it every night and it’s free), whether you should spend your money on things like cryospas, and whether recovery methods can still be beneficial, even if they're largely based on the placebo effect. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/recovery" target="_blank">aom.is/recovery</a>.</p>
