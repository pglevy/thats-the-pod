<p>Have you ever been sitting at your office desk and found yourself daydreaming about becoming a farmer? </p><p>My guest today has written a practical, all-encompassing handbook to help you turn that dream into a reality. His name is <a href="http://forrestpritchard.com" target="_blank">Forrest Pritchard</a>. He's a farmer and the co-author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1615194894/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1615194894&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Start Your Own Farm: The Authoritative Guide to Becoming a Sustainable 21st Century Farmer</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing the state of the farming profession and the social and economic forces that have made it harder and harder to pursue. Despite the headwinds facing would-be farmers, Forrest makes the case for why farming can still be a fulfilling and financially sustainable profession. He then delves into the nitty gritty of starting and running a farm, including start-up costs, land acquisition, deciding on what to farm, creating multiple revenue streams, pricing product, and figuring out where to sell your goods. We then discuss the mental and emotional toll of farming and how to manage burnout. </p><p>If you've ever dreamed about becoming a farmer, this episode will provide a lot of useful information. Even if you don't want to become a farmer, you'll find this to be a surprisingly interesting look at a lesser known lifestyle, and gain insights that are applicable to any business and to life in general. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/startyourfarm" target="_blank">aom.is/startyourfarm</a>.</p>
