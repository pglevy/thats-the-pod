<p>The holiday season is upon us. It's a time for getting cozy, making memories, and looking forward to the new year ahead.</p><p>My guest today has plenty of research-backed insights on how to take each of those things to the next level. His name is Meik Wiking, and he's the CEO of the <a href="https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/" target="_blank">Happiness Research Institute</a> and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062658808/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062658808&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062943383/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062943383&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Art of Making Memories: How to Create and Remember Happy Moments</em></a>. We begin our discussion exploring the Danish concept of hygge, which is the art of getting cozy, and how it helps Danes survive their long, harsh winters. Mike also discusses his research on how to create lasting memories. We then combine these ideas to explore how lighting, food, scent, and more can help you inject more hygge into the holiday season, and make Christmas and the coming year your most memorable yet.</p><p>You'll want to grab a hot cocoa and wrap yourself in a blanket before cozying up to this show.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/cozy" target="_blank">aom.is/cozy</a>.</p>
