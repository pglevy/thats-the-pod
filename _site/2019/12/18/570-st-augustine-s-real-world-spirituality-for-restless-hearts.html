<p>Do you feel restless? Have you ever lied in bed at night looking up at the ceiling wondering "Is this all there is to life?" Or have you ever achieved a big goal in life only to feel let down?</p>
<p>Over 1500 years ago, Catholic bishop, philosopher and theologian Augustine of Hippo had those same feelings of angst and wrote down some insights on how to deal with them and they're just as relevant today as they were then. </p>
<p>My guest today has written a book about Augustine's ancient insights on the anxiety of modern life and how this famous Catholic theologian has had a profound impact on Western philosophy, including among 20th-century existential philosophers. His name is <a href="https://jameskasmith.com/">James K. A. Smith</a> and his book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587433893/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1587433893&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>On the Road with Saint Augustine</em></a>. We begin our show discussing Augustine's biography and his oft-overlooked influence on atheistic existential philosophers like Heidegger, Sartre, and Camus. </p>
<p>We then dig into the big ideas that Augustine hit on his famous book<em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199537828/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199537828&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">Confessions</a></em> including how to deal with existential angst, how to find your true self, what it means to be truly free in life, and how to deal with our restless ambition. Along the way, James shows how 20th-century existential philosophers dealt with these questions, why he thinks existentialism falls shorts to answering them, and why Augustine's solutions might be better.</p>
<p>Lots of great insights about big life questions in this episode.</p>
