<p>Listen as you drive through most neighborhoods in America these days and you might notice something missing: the shrieks and laughter of kids playing outside. </p><p>When my guest today had kids, he decided he wasn't going to let them grow up in another quiet, morgue-like neighborhood. Instead, he was going to figure out why kids weren't playing outside anymore, and how to fix the problem. His name is <a href="http://playborhood.com" target="_blank">Mike Lanza</a>, and in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984929819/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0984929819&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Playborhood: Turn Your Neighborhood Into a Place for Play</em></a>, he shares how he did just that. At the start of our conversation, Mike explains how he became an advocate for kids playing outside by themselves with minimal adult supervision. He shares his theories on why outdoor play has decreased, and why simply limiting screen time and participation in organized extracurriculars doesn't solve the problem. Mike then explains why you need a critical mass of kids to be playing outside before outdoor play becomes a norm, and what parents can do to create this critical mass by changing the environment in their yard and the social dynamics in their neighborhood.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/playborhood" target="_blank">aom.is/playborhood</a>.</p>
