<p>If you struggle with procrastination, goal-setting, and generally moving ahead in life, the heart of your struggles may be your view of time. More specifically, that you look at it too linearly. </p><p>That's the argument my guest today makes. His name is <a href="https://www.stevechandler.com/index.html" target="_blank">Steve Chandler</a>, he's a success and business coach, and the author of many books, including the focus of our discussion today -- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600250378/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1600250378&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Time Warrior: How to Defeat Procrastination, People-Pleasing, Self-Doubt, Over-Commitment, Broken Promises and Chaos</em></a>. At the beginning of our conversation, Steve shares how he personally overcame years of failure and addiction to find a fulfilling life and career. He then explains why looking at time too linearly can lead to putting things off to the future, overwhelm and over-thinking, and perpetually trying to find more information before moving on an idea. He argues that we're better served by adopting a concept of non-linear time management, which pushes us to approach life with a bias towards action, privilege the energy of "want to" over "know-how," and act in the now. We then discuss other tactics and mindsets you can adopt to become a "time warrior," including being creative rather than reactive, seeing life as a game, and serving people rather than pleasing them. We end our conversation with what to do when you feel like you don't know what to do with your life.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/timewarrior" target="_blank">aom.is/timewarrior</a>.</p>
