<p>When you invite people over for a dinner party, you likely think of some delightful conversation topics to bring up to keep your guests engaged. My guest today argues that one of those topics should be death.</p><p>His name is <a href="http://hebb.life/" target="_blank">Michael Hebb</a> and heâ€™s the founder of <a href="https://deathoverdinner.org/" target="_blank">Death Over Dinner</a>, an organization that encourages folks to have dinner parties to talk about death -- from the philosophical aspects to practical matters like wills and funeral planning. </p><p>Today on the show we discuss why you should invite friends and family to your house to talk death over a plate of lasagna. We begin our conversation discussing the downsides of not talking about death and how ill-prepared Americans are for death both emotionally and financially. Michael then shares the best ways to invite people to a death over dinner party. We then dig into questions you can use to get people talking about death in terms of both the practical and the philosophical. </p><p>True story: after I recorded this episode, I had dinner with some friends and we discussed death and estate planning over pizza. It was a big success.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/deathoverdinner" target="_blank">aom.is/deathoverdinner</a>.</p>
