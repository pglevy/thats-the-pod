<p>We&apos;re introducing a new segment called Last Week with Jason Fried, where Basecamp&apos;s CEO talks about a task or concern that recently fell on his plate. In this inaugural episode, Jason talks about how the end of the company&apos;s lease on its Chicago office leaves him with a big decision on how to design a space for a mostly remote workforce and whether Basecamp needs an office at all. Meanwhile, all work and no play makes Shaun a dull boy.</p>
