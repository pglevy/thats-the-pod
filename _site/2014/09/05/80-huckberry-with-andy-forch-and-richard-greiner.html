<p>Today I talk with Andy Forch and Richard Greiner, the co-founders of the men's online store Huckberry. If you're a business owner or have thought about starting your own business, this podcast is for you. I ask Andy and Rich to share how they bootstrapped a business they started into their apartment and turned it into one of the largest men's e-commerce stores on the web. As a business that's in the business of curating men's lifestyle products, Andy and Rich have seen first-hand what separates a successful men's product from an unsuccessful one and what you can do to standout from the crowded &quot;artisanal&quot; men's products.</p>
