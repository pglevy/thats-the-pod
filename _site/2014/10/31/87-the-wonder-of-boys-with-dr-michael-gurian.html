<p>I talk to boyhood psychology expert, Dr. Michael Gurian about his book, The Wonder of Boys. We discuss how biological differences between boys and girls affect the neurology and consequently the psychology of boys as well as how schools and therapists have overlooked these differences to the detriment of boys. Gurian provides insights into what boys need in order to grow into strong, mentally and emotionally healthy men, and what parents can do to provide that environment to boys. If you're a dad, this is a definite must-listen. Lots of great actionable information here to help your son to become a good, strong man.</p>
