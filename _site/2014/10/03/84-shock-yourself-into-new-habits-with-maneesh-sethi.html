<p>Maneesh Sethi is the creator of Pavlok. It's a wearable device that connects to your smartphone and helps you make and break habits. One of the things Pavlok does is shock you if you do something you're not supposed to be doing, like visiting a time wasting site like Facebook, or when you don't do what you should be doing, like going to the gym. I talk to Maneesh about habits and the power of punishment in getting us to do what we should be doing. We also discuss the ways men and women differ in forming habits. Lots of great, practical info in this podcast. If you're looking for more info about Pavlok visit aom.is/pavlok.</p>
