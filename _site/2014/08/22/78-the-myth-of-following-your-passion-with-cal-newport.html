<p>I talk to Cal Newport, author of the book So Good They Can't Ignore Ignore You. In his book Cal makes that case that &quot;following your passion&quot; is terrible career advice and can actually cause people needless anxiety and problems in their lives because they're constantly jumping from one career to the next.  Instead of &quot;following your passion&quot;,  he argues that you should instead focus on developing mastery in a skill that will allow you to build up career capital,  which in turns opens up more opportunities for control of you work, which in turn allows you to cultivate a job that you're passionate about. Fulfilling work comes from cultivating your passion, not following it.  This is a must listen to podcast for our college-aged listeners as well as for folks who've felt a twinge of anxiety about whether they're in the right job.</p>
