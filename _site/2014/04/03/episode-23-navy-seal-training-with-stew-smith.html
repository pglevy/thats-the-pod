<p>In this week's episode of the Art of Manliness podcast we talk to personal trainer, Stew Smith. Stew is a former Navy SEAL who now devotes his time to helping other men train and prepare for work in special operations. He's developed fitness programs for men working in the military, special operations, firefighting, and police work.<br />We talk about how a man can prepare physically for SEAL training, what lessons in manliness we can take from SEALs, and Stew's approach to fitness and nutrition.</p>
