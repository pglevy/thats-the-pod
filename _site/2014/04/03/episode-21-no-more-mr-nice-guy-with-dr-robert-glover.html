<p>We've all heard the phrase &quot;Nice guys finish last,&quot; right? Why is that? Why do the men whose women friends tell him he'll make a great catch never have a date come Friday night? Or why does the guy who never rocks the boat at work never get the promotion? To answer these questions we talked to Dr. Robert Glover, author of the book No More Mr. Nice Guy: A Proven Plan For Getting What You Want In Love, Sex, and Life.<br />We discuss the attributes of these Nice Guys, why there's been a proliferation of Nice Guys during the past 30 years, and what men can do to beat the Nice Guy Syndrome and get more out of life.</p>
