<p>Welcome back to another edition of the Art of Manliness podcast! Today, I'm going to start a new series on the show called &quot;Man Stories.&quot; Every other week, I'm going to bring on a different gentleman who reads the blog and ask him a few questions about what manliness means to him and the men who have had an influence on his perception of manliness. I'm looking forward to this series. It will be interesting to hear different men explain their view of manliness, plus I think it's a great way to get to know more about the men who read and take part with the Art of Manliness.</p>
