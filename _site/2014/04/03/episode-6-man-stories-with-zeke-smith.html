<p>Welcome back to another episode of The Art of Manliness podcast. This week we return to our series called &quot;Man Stories&quot; where we interview a regular man and ask him what manliness means to him. Our guest this week is Zeke Smith. Zeke is an American living in England while his wife pursues her masters at the University of Manchester. Thanks Zeke for talking with us!<br />Editor's Note: I had some problems with the sound on this episode. I apologize for the quality. I hope to have the recording problem remedied next week.</p>
