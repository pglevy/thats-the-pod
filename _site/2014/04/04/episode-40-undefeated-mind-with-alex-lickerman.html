<p>So after being in hiatus for nearly a year, I've decided to bring back the Art of Manliness podcast. Thanks to all those who emailed and messaged me asking to bring it back.<br />To kick off the resurrection of the AoM podcast, I talk to Dr. Alex Lickerman. Dr. Lickerman is a practicing physician and author of a recently published book entitled, The Undefeated Mind: On the Science of  Constructing an Indestructible Self. If you enjoyed our series on the power of resilience, you're going enjoy my conversation with Dr. Lickerman and his book, Undefeated Mind.</p>
