<p>In today's episode I talk to writer Steven Pressfield. Steven has written over a dozen books ranging from fiction and non-fiction. His book Gates of Fire, a fictional account of the Battle of Thermopylae, is used by the Marine Corps Basic School and his non-fiction books have become go-to guides for writers, entrepreneurs, and other creative types. Steve and I talk about why war plays a central theme in all his work and how to apply the Warrior Ethos to creative work.</p>
