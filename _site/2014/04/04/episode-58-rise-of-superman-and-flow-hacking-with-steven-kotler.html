<p>In this episode of the AoM podcast, I talk to science journalist Steven Kotler about his new book The Rise of Superman: Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance. In his book, Steven takes a look at the world of extreme athletes and discovers that these so-called adrenaline junkies are pushing the boundaries of human performance, and it isn't the adrenaline that's driving these advances. Rather, it's the concept of flow -- an optimal state of attention that slows down time and makes life-or-death decision making possible.<br />In The Rise of Superman, Steven gives examples of extreme athletes -- like big wave surfers, solo rock climbers, and base jumpers -- who are tapping into flow to do the seemingly impossible. What's more, he shares research-backed ways that Average Joes can hack their own flow so that they can improve their performance across all facets of life and truly flourish.</p>
