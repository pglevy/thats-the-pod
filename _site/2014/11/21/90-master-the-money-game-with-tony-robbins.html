<p>I talk to famous motivational speaker Tony Robbins about his new book &quot;Money: Master the Game.&quot; Tony and I talk about what he learned after interviewing the world's most successful investors and how average Joes can apply it in their own life. We discuss the myths that are preventing people from saving enough from retirement, why you should avoid actively managed mutual funds, why NOT losing money is one of the most important investment strategies, and how to create a portfolio that can withstand the sometimes violent ebbs and flows of the stock market.</p>
