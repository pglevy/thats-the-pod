<p>With some thought and intentionality, you can help ensure that you have a happy, loving, fulfilling relationship that lasts until death do you part.<br />My guest today is Les Parrot and he’s a clinical psychologist specializing in marriage and family. He, along with wife Leslie, who's also a marriage therapist, have written a book to help couples prepare themselves for matrimonial commitment. It’s called &quot;Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts: Seven Questions to Ask Before— And After—You Marry.&quot;<br />Today on the show, Les and I discuss how a man can know if he’s personally ready for marriage, the myths people have about marriage that set them up for disappointment, and the conversations you should be having with your future spouse to help ensure you have a happy life together. While the conversation is geared towards soon-to-be marrieds and newlyweds, even if you’ve been married for a couple decades, you’re going to find some useful advice and insights in this show.</p>
