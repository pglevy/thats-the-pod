<p>Ben and David return to make their first foray into enterprise software, covering Salesforce’s $2.5B acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013 with the help of special guest and ExactTarget cofounder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-dorsey-096b393">Scott Dorsey</a>.   <em>Technical note: due to an issue we didn’t catch during recording, audio quality is significantly lower than usual for this episode (especially David’s voice). We apologize but hope you’ll give it a chance anyway— Scott offers great wisdom &amp; insights, and the ExactTarget success story is a inspiring one underdog entrepreneurs, especially (but not limited to!) anyone located in the Midwest or elsewhere outside of traditional "Silicon Valley-style” tech hubs. <br><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br></em><br>Topics covered include: </p><ul><li>The decision to start ExactTarget post-internet bubble and in Indianapolis, with zero software experience between Scott and cofounders Chris Baggott &amp; Peter McCormick</li><li>Raising initial money from friends &amp; family, followed by early investment and mentoring from Indianapolis venture pioneer <a href="http://www.ibj.com/articles/58776-bob-compton-helped-plant-seeds-of-now-flourishing-local-tech-community">Bob Compton</a></li><li>Building and scaling a great sales organization within a technology company</li><li>The importance of focusing early on a clearly defined target market (SMBs in the case of ExactTarget), and then “stair-stepping” up as the product and business scale grow over time</li><li>ExactTarget’s unsuccessful <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1420850/000104746907010051/a2181554zs-1.htm">first IPO filing</a> during the financial crisis</li><li>Building a "capital-efficient” early stage company, and the value of raising growth capital at the right time to step on the accelerator</li><li>The value of “secondary” investments allowing founders, employees &amp; early investors to “stay hungry” by achieving some liquidity along the way</li><li>When and how to expand internationally and the importance of strategic resellers</li><li>ExactTarget’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1420850/000119312512124845/d256812ds1a.htm">second successful IPO filing</a> and life as a public company with quarterly financial reporting to Wall Street</li><li>How the acquisition process played out with Salesforce and other bidders (including reference to ExactTarget’s incredible <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1420850/000119312513255538/d548389dsc14d9.htm">SEC filing</a> detailing the entire negotiation—scroll down to "Background and Reasons for the ExactTarget Board’s Recommendation”, starting at the bottom of page 13)</li><li>Approaching the difficult task of integrating a major acquisition involving thousands of people</li><li>The fun story of ExactTarget’s winning Microsoft as a large customer—including actual sledgehammers</li><li>Scott’s new Indianapolis-based venture studio, <a href="http://highalpha.com/">High Alpha</a></li><li>Plus as always the "hard hitting" analysis across acquisition category, what would have happened otherwise, tech themes—and final grading</li></ul><p>  The Carve Out </p><ul><li>Ben: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/06/17/ep-158">The Talk Show live at WWDC 2016</a> with <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/philip-w-schiller.html">Phil Schiller</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/craig-federighi.html">Craig Federighi</a></li><li>David: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Score-Takes-Care-Itself-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B002G54Y04">The Score Takes Care of Itself</a> by legendary 49ers coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)">Bill Walsh</a>, originally recommended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEQawgkCMOU">Jack Dorsey [no relation to Scott :) ] at YC Startup School '13</a></li><li>Scott: 2016 <a href="http://spellingbee.com/">Scipps National Spelling Bee</a>, including one of the finalists’ favorite words: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=indefatigable&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">indefatigable</a></li></ul><p>  Followups: </p><ul><li>Instagram’s incredible user numbers announcement: 500M monthly active users / 300M daily active users</li></ul>
