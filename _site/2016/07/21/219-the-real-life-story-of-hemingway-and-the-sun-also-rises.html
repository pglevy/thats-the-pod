<p>Ernest Hemingway is a literary legend, but unlike many literary legends, he gained that status while at the very beginning of his career when he introduced his first novel, The Sun Also Rises.<br />My guest today has published a detailed account of how Hemingway created his first novel. Her name is Lesley Blume and her book is &quot;Everybody Behaves Badly: The True Story Behind Hemingway’s Masterpiece The Sun Also Rises.&quot; Today on the show, Lesley and I discuss Hemingway’s drive to revolutionize literature, the authenticity of his manly persona, and the real life party in Spain that inspired his classic debut novel.</p>
