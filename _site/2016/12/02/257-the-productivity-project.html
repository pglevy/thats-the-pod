His name is Chris Bailey and he’s the author of &quot;The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy.&quot; Today on the show, Chris and I discuss the common misconceptions about productivity that lead people astray in their goals, why having a “why” is the most important step in becoming more productive, and why planning your day around your personal energy cycle can boost your productivity significantly. Chris also gives specific tactics to beat procrastination, strengthen your ability to focus, and manage your to-do list.<br />This episode is chalk full of actionable advice, so take notes.</p>
