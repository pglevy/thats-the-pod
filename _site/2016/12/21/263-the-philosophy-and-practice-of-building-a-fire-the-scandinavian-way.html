<p>What is it about making and warming ourselves with woodburning flame that's so satisfying? And how can we better master the art of firemaking?<br />Well my guest today has published a book that’s become a cult classic in Scandinavia and it’s all about wood and fire. His name is Lars Mytting and his book is &quot;Norwegian Wood: Chopping, Stacking, and Drying Wood the Scandinavian Way.&quot; Today on the show, Lars and I discuss the pleasures of preparing wood for a fire and why firewood is an important part of man’s identity in Scandinavian countries. We go on to talk about the best kind of wood for fires, how to fell trees for firewood, how to season your wood for optimal fire building, and the best time to split wood.<br />This is a show both philosophical and practical, and it will leave you wanting to build the best fireplace fire of your life when you’re done listening.</p>
