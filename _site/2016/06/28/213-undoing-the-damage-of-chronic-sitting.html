<p>If you're like most men who work a 9-5 job at an office, you're probably spending a lot of that time sitting down at a desk. Then when you get home, you might be a little active, but then you'll sit down at your desk in your home office, or you'll sit on the couch and watch TV. All that sitting is not good for your body. Some doctors even say it does as much damage to your body as smoking does.<br />My guest today highlights all this research in a new book called Deskbound. In the show, Kelly Starrett and I discuss the dangers of sitting, and what you can do to un-do all that damage. There are a lot of great action steps that you can take right away. Don't miss it!</p>
