<p>Have you ever spent an entire day at work feeling really busy, checking emails, reading your news feed -- and at the end of the day you realize, &quot;Man, I really wasn't all that productive.&quot; You felt busy but your brain was fuzzy and didn't end up doing all that much.<br />If that sounds familiar, today's show is for you. My guest, Cal Newport, has a new book out called Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. I'm not joking when I say this has been a life-changing book for me. We talk about the principles of deep work, plus the nuts and bolts of being more focused with your day.</p>
