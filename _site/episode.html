        Henry Dreyfuss was a leader of the first generation of industrial
        designers. He and his team were responsible for the design of some
        of most ubiquitous and iconic products of the mid-twentieth century:
        the Bell Model 500 telephone, the Honeywell Round thermostat, and
        the Polaroid Automatic 100 Land Camera, among many other products
        and services.
      </p>

        Similar to how George Washington established precedents for the
        American presidency, Dreyfuss was a founding father of American
        industrial design. He defined expectations for the role of designer
        and their relationship to engineering and marketing; the balance
        between commercial objectives and human needs; and the philosophy of
        design not as a stylistic afterthought, but as an integral part of
        creating “classic” products that stand the test of time.

        In his book, <em>The Man in the Brown Suit</em>, Russell Flinchum
        draws on a wealth of primary sources to explore how Dreyfuss
        transitioned from a theater designer in the 1920s to one of the “big
        four” industrial designers during the so-called golden age of
        industrial design. This monograph (a detailed study on a specialized
        subject) accompanied a 1997 exhibition of Dreyfuss’s work at the
        Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, where Flinchum was a fellow.
        From the 1920s through the 60s, Flinchum covers how Dreyfuss’s work
        evolved and his influence grew while staying committed to the Five
        Points that outlined his design philosophy: safety and convenience
        of use, ease of maintenance, cost, appeal, and appearance —
        importantly, in that order.
      </p>

        Referred to as both the “dean” and the “conscience” of the field, he
        was considered by his friends, family, and colleagues, above all, a
        person of integrity. As a user experience designer working on
        enterprise software products today, I think we can learn from how
        Dreyfuss championed human values during a period of tremendous
        technological advancement. At the time, it was unprecedented for a
        designer and his team to have such a widespread impact on the public
        consumer. He took a principled, considered approach to design that
        we apparently had to relearn in the twenty-first century with the
        advent of the internet and the digital age. I first read this book
        about ten years ago, and as I’ve gone back through it, taking
        copious notes and capturing inspiring quotes, I’ve regained an
        appreciation for some of the practical insights and creative
        mindsets that have influenced me over the years, and reconsidered
        how I can apply Dreyfuss’s knowledge, experience, and spirit to my
        own work.
