<p>It's often said &quot;time is money,&quot; but do you really treat your time like money? Well, my guest today on the podcast says, no, most people don't, but if they did they'd be much wiser stewards of their time. Her name is Elizabeth Grace Saunders and she's the author of the book &quot;Invest Your Time Like Money&quot; and today on the podcast we discuss what you can do today so you get out of &quot;time debt&quot; and invest time so you have more of it in the future. If you're feeling busy and overwhelmed, this podcast is for you.</p>
