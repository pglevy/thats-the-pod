<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and econometrician Peter Arcidiacono discuss the recent landmark decision by the Supreme Court to end Affirmative Action, how his research was instrumental in that outcome, why merit is repeatedly proven to be the best indicator of success, how compassion is used to cloak racial discrimination, and what might actually yield results in service to the under-resourced communities across the United States.</p><p>Â </p><p>Peter Arcidiacono is the William Henry Glasson Professor of Economics at Duke University. He received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999 and has taught at Duke University ever since. He is a fellow of the Econometric Society and the International Association of Applied Econometricians. He is best known for his work in three areas: college major choice, affirmative action in higher education, and structural estimation of dynamic discrete choice models. He served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court cases SFFA v. Harvard and SFFA v. UNC, examining the role race played in the admissions process at both institutions.</p>
