<p>Note: This is a rebroadcast. </p><p>Do you ever get to feeling kind of down, dejected, and anxious come Sunday evening? People refer to this phenomenon as the “Sunday Night Blues,” and it’s a common experience. You may have chalked it up to rueing the fact that your fun and restful weekend is over, and that you have yet another workweek ahead.</p><p>But my guest would say that your Sunday night sadness may also be rooted in the feeling of regret — the regret that you <i>didn’t</i> put your weekend to good use, that it <i>wasn’t</i> restful and fun, and that it was instead busy, draining, and, once again, a big letdown. Her name is Katrina Onstad, and she’s the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3nOdorY"><i>The Weekend Effect</i></a>. Today Katrina shares how the idea of the weekend, of having two back-to-back days off from work, came about, and how it’s been challenged and subsequently eroded in the modern day. We then talk about how to take back your weekends, so that your invaluable Saturdays and Sundays feel more the way they did when you were a kid — filled with a sense of possibility.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monday">Saint Monday</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair">Haymarket square affair</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-602-the-case-for-being-unproductive/">AoM Podcast #602: The Case for Being Unproductive</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-450-how-to-make-time-for-what-really-matters-every-day/">AoM Podcast #450: How to Make Time for What Really Matters</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/time-management-for-mortals/">AoM Podcast #748: Time Management for Mortals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-743-how-to-get-time-priorities-and-energy-working-in-your-favor/">AoM Podcast #743: How to Get Time, Priorities, and Energy Working in Your Favor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/how-to-better-manage-your-life-admin/">AoM Article: How to Better Manage Your Life Admin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/viewers-vs-doers-the-rise-of-spectatoritis/">AoM Article: The Rise of Spectatoritis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/the-lost-art-of-cheap-recreation/">AoM Article: The Lost Art of Cheap Recreation</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Katrina Onstad</h2><ul><li><a href="https://katrinaonstad.com/">Katrina’s Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/11/the-weekend-effect-1.jpeg" alt="" width="350" />
