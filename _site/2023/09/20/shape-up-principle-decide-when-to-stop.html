<p>In our recent episodes, we&apos;ve been talking about the principles of Shape Up – the cornerstone of 37signals&apos; product development philosophy. We&apos;ve explored the art of <a href='https://37signals.com/podcast/writing-a-pitch/'>crafting a pitch</a> and the decision-making process that takes place at the <a href='https://37signals.com/podcast/shape-up-principle-the-betting-table/'>betting table</a>. </p><p><br/></p><p>Shape Up acknowledges that there&apos;s always more work than time allows, and on today’s episode, we’re zeroing in on a critical aspect of the Shape Up philosophy—when to stop tinkering and take the leap and ship.</p><p><br/></p><p>Join Kimberly Rhodes and 37signals co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson as they share their wisdom on the ever-present dilemma of shipping on time versus shipping perfect, and the fine balance between must-haves and nice-to-haves in product development. Plus, the value of <a href='https://basecamp.com/hill-charts'>Hill Charts</a> in Basecamp to keep you tethered to the reality of where your project truly stands.</p><p><br/></p><p>Listen in as Jason and David provide practical strategies to master the art of timely product delivery that doesn&apos;t sacrifice quality to ensure your team stays on the path to success.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href='https://youtu.be/hM9F8YUKDK4'>Check out the full video episode on YouTube</a></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p><br/></p><p>[00:00] - There&apos;s always more work than there is time, and at some point, you must stop and ship and that&apos;s the topic of our conversation today. </p><p>[00:44] - Jason talks about the importance of shipping on time without sacrificing quality.</p><p>[02:29] - David uses a racing analogy to explain how viewing work through a budgeted timeframe helps you prioritize (and shed excess scope). </p><p>[03:21] - The effectiveness of constraints in achieving better results.</p><p>[04:18] - How embracing constraints leads to better software.</p><p>[05:23] - How the two-person teams decide on &quot;must haves&quot; vs. &quot;nice to haves.&quot; </p><p>[07:51] - Constraints allow for reevaluation of the problem statement, highlighting that even the &quot;epicenter&quot; of a feature can be redefined, leading to scope reduction.</p><p>[10:08] - How timelines keep you honest and keep you from chasing bad money. </p><p>[11:47] - The value of &quot;Hill Charts&quot; in Basecamp</p><p> and why complex issues on the other side of the hill pose a greater challenge.</p><p>[12:44] - Jason explains that in the Shape Up methodology, if something isn&apos;t completed within the timeframe, it isn&apos;t automatically reintroduced—it has to fight for its relevance.</p><p>[14:08] - How to avoid the &quot;too big to fail.&quot;</p><p>[14:21] - David explains how to use the &quot;penalty box&quot; concept to keep yourself honest in product development.</p><p>[15:08] - The importance of guidelines and guardrails in getting you where you want to go. </p><p>[19:08] - When should a project transition to a more formalized approach like Shape Up using the example of <a href='https://www.hey.com/world/'>HEY</a>.</p><p>[20:45] - Why you should allow for experimentation in the initial exploration phase of new product development.</p><p>[21:50] - You can read more about Shape Up, 37signals philosophy around product development in the book <a href='https://basecamp.com/books/shapeup'><em>Shape Up</em></a>.
