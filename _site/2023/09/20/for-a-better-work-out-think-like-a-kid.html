<p>According to some estimates, only 5% of people in the West get the recommended amount of daily physical activity. Is the solution getting a fitness tracker, developing more discipline, or buying a piece of cardio equipment for your basement?</p><p>My guest would say none of the above, and would have you think about kids playing at recess instead.</p><p>Darryl Edwards is the founder of the <a href="https://www.primalplay.com/">Primal Play Method</a>. Today on the show, we discuss the epidemic of sedentariness which besets both adults and children and why technology and willpower isn’t the cure for it. Darryl then explains why a better solution to getting more movement and physical activity in our lives is rediscovering the intrinsically motivating pleasure of play. He offers suggestions on how to do that, including compiling a play history for your life, embracing “primal movements” that will get you moving like an animal and a child, and getting over the fear of looking goofy while doing so. We discuss the joys and health benefits of exploring your capabilities and environment and how to incorporate more movement into your busy adult life by making even regular activities more playful.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Darryl’s books:<ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PcoSDp" target="_blank"><i>Animal Moves: How to Move Like an Animal to Get You Leaner, Fitter, Stronger and Healthier for Life</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Animal-Moves-Childrens-Encourage/dp/0993329888/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=leyN1&content-id=amzn1.sym.579192ca-1482-4409-abe7-9e14f17ac827&pf_rd_p=579192ca-1482-4409-abe7-9e14f17ac827&pf_rd_r=136-3887125-4860856&pd_rd_wg=KdJDL&pd_rd_r=e6738fe8-5620-4d78-ad7d-0c305a084873&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk" target="_blank"><i>My First Animal Moves: A Children’s Book to Encourage Kids and Their Parents to Move More, Sit Less and Decrease Screen Time</i></a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/Get%20Fit%20Like%20a%20Wild%20Man:%20A%20Primer%20on%20MovNat" target="_blank">AoM Article: Get Fit Like a Wild Man — A Primer on MovNat</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/10-physical-skills-every-man-master/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The 10 Physical Skills Every Man Should Master</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/the-importance-of-having-a-physical-identity/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Importance of Having a Physical Identity</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-24-play/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 30 Days to a Better Man Day 24 — Play!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-508-break-out-of-your-cage-and-stop-being-a-human-zoo-animal/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #508: Break Out of Your Cage and Stop Being a Human Zoo Animal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-245-workout-world-forgot/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #245: The Workout the World Forgot</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/podcast-749-let-the-children-play/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #749: Let the Children Play!</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Darryl Edwards</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.primalplay.com/" target="_blank">Primal Play website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/fitnessexplorer?locale=en_GB" target="_blank">Darryl on FB</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fitnessexplorer/" target="_blank">Darryl on IG</a></li></ul>
