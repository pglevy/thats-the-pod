(Founders #220)</p><p>(7:00) <a href="https://amzn.to/3sSwU7D">Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans</a> by A. J. Baime. (Founders #97)</p><p>(14:30) I determined to build a car of my own. I had realized by then that I was completely taken by mechanics. My ideas gave me no rest.</p><p>(16:00) The two inventors described to each other a singular experience: Each had imagined a perfect new product, whole, already manufactured and sitting before him, and then spent years prodding executives, engineers, and factories to create it with as few compromises as possible. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3Cslm35">Instant: The Story of Polaroid</a> by Christopher Bonanos. (Founders #264)</p><p>(22:00) Faster progress would be made in all fields if conceit did not cause us to forget or disdain the work done by others before us. There is a tendency to believe that nothing worthy of note has been done in the past, and this has an unfortunate bearing on our judgment; thus the present trend toward mediocrity.</p><p>(23:45) I was hypnotized, drawn more and more to the mechanics of motors. These exciting problems had me completely under their sway, and so began for me the hard uphill task, the thankless labor of constructing and destroying and beginning again, without a break or rest,  and for days, months, years even, until success finally rewarded all my efforts.</p><p>(27:00) Bugatti made no attempt to compete with the low price models already on the market. The price of the Bugatti was higher than any other car of equal horsepower.</p><p>(37:00) Bugatti is the personification of Paul Graham’s essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">How To Do Great Work</a>(Founders #314)</p><p>-Work on what you have a natural aptitude for and a deep curiosity about.</p><p>-Make a commitment to be the best in the world at what you do.</p><p>-Care deeply about making truly great work.</p><p>(42:00) All the finest trophies were won easily by engaging in every important race without pause.</p><p>(44:00) Nothing is too good. Nothing is too dear. You've got to win whatever the cost. You work day and night if necessary.</p><p>(44:30) There was a factory. However Molsheim was more than that. It was a house and a family. It was a little world where the attitude to things and the relations between people were out of the ordinary.</p><p>(45:30) The personality of its founder continued to show in even the smallest details and unexpected ways.</p><p>(46:00) You get the feeling of being suddenly confronted with something unusual and beyond classification.</p><p>(49:30) His starting point was always to create the most extraordinary things.</p><p>(50:30) <a href="https://amzn.to/3H5dgPq">Against the Odds: An Autobiography by James Dyson</a> (Founders #300)</p><p>(52:00) The root principle was to do things your way. It didn't matter how other people did it. As long as it works and it is exciting people will follow you.</p><p>(58:30) A human life, by its very nature, has to be devoted to something or other, to a glorious or humble enterprise, an illustrious or obscure destiny. This is a strange but inexorable condition of things. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3Qz1odZ">The Revolt of the Masses</a> by Jose Ortega y Gasset</p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested, so my poor wallet suffers</i>.” — Gareth</p><p>Be like Gareth.
