<p>When an organization wants to get more productive and better reach its goals, it typically looks to retool its leadership, trying to find lone figures who can apply more effective top-down control. But my guest says there’s a much more effective strategy for getting things done: creating and empowering teams of self-starters.</p><p>Kyle Buckett is a retired Navy SEAL, an executive consultant, and the co-author of<br /><a href="https://amzn.to/44yUecZ"><i>Leadership Is Overrated: How the Navy SEALs (and Successful Businesses) Create Self-Leading Teams That Win</i></a>.
