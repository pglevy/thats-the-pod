<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Helen Joyce discuss the takedown of their last interview on youtube, the true tradition of women’s rights, and the harsh reality of what women stand to lose today.</p><p> </p><p>Helen Joyce is an Irish novelist and journalist, acting as the executive editor for events and business at the Economist in London. Before this, she trained as a mathematician, graduating from the Trinity College in Dublin, before attending Cambridge. She then acquired a PhD in geometric measure theory at the University College London. She has held many roles as a journalist, working for PLUS Magazine and Significance Magazine, both of which have an emphasis on communicating complex math and statistics to the everyday reader. Later, she would spend three years as the Economist’s foreign correspondent to Brazil, living in São Paulo. In 2018, Joyce curated a series of articles on transgender identity, which led her to author the Sunday Times bestselling book, “Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality.”</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Helen Joyce:</p><p> </p><p>On Twitter @HJoyceGender https://twitter.com/HJoyceGender</p><p> </p><p>Newsletter https://www.thehelenjoyce.com/</p><p> </p><p>Help support Sex Matters https://sex-matters.org/</p><p> </p><p>Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Trans-When-Ideology-Meets-Reality/dp/0861540492 </p>
