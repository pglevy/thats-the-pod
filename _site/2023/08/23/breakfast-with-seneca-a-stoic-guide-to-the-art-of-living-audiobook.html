<p>Above is an audiobook excerpt from David Fideler’s <em>Breakfast with Seneca: A Stoic Guide to the Art of Living.</em><em> </em>Special thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and Tantor Media & HighBridge Audio. </p><p>In<em> Breakfast with Seneca</em>, philosopher David Fideler mines Seneca's classic works in a series of focused chapters, clearly explaining Seneca's ideas without oversimplifying them. Best enjoyed as a daily ritual, like an energizing cup of coffee, Seneca's wisdom provides us with a steady stream of time-tested advice about the human condition - which, as it turns out, hasn't changed much over the past 2,000 years.</p><p>The most companionable of the new Stoic books.</p><p>—Molly Young, New York Times</p><p>David Fideler is an esteemed guest speaker at our upcoming virtual event, <em>On Seneca: Anger, Fear, and Sadness</em> on Saturday, August 19th @ 12 pm EDT.

Donations also go towards funding a PAC on-site location near the original Plato’s Academy in Akadimia Platonos,<strong> </strong>Athens. No need to worry if you are unavailable on the day. A recording will be sent to all registrants post event. </p><p>Also, all attendees are eligible to win a paperback copy of David’s acclaimed <em>Breakfast with Seneca</em>! A form will be sent to registrants post event for entry. Then, three lucky winners will be selected.  </p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Plato's Academy Centre Newsletter at <a href="https://platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTE5ODY2NiwiaWF0IjoxNzA4ODM0NjY1LCJleHAiOjE3MTE0MjY2NjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTk0NTEyIiwic3ViIjoiY2hlY2tvdXQifQ.dY7f9hfeN1pSWp4rXGIriFFtkR1Oe3juiS552cg7I5M&#38;utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe</a>
