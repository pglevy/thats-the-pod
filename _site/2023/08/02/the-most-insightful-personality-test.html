<p>Personality tests sometimes come in for criticism these days for not being very accurate or helpful or for putting people into boxes. And it’s true that no test can ever entirely peg the complexities of personality, and they shouldn’t be applied with too much rigidity. But what these tests are useful for is serving as a prompt for reflecting on the particular ways you think, feel, and act, and, perhaps even more importantly, getting you to think about the fact that other people can see and approach the world in ways that are fundamentally different from your own.</p><p>I haven’t found a personality test that better serves as this kind of tool than what’s called the <a href="https://amzn.to/3OcYlFs">“People Code”</a> or the “Color Code,” which categorizes people into four colors: Reds, Blues, Whites, and Yellows. I’ve found it uncanningly insightful in helping me understand myself and others better, and it’s become a regular topic of conversation amongst my family and friends.</p><p>Today I talk to the creator of the Color Code Personality Profile, psychologist Dr. Taylor Hartman. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the four color types, how to interact with each color to bring out their best traits, and how the colors combine in relationships. We then discuss the importance of developing the strengths of other colors besides your own, a process Taylor calls becoming “charactered.”</p><h2><strong>Learn More/Connect With Taylor Hartman</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://taylorhartman.com/" target="_blank">Taylor’s Website</a></li><li><a href="https://taylorhartman.com/assessment-information/" target="_blank">Take the ColorCode Assessment</a><ul><li>Discount code for the assessment: AOM30</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3KkJRlL" target="_blank"><i>The People Code</i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/454EMpH" target="_blank"><i>The Character Code</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-hartman-29b37a1" target="_blank">Taylor on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/08/61ExKhd6wOL.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
