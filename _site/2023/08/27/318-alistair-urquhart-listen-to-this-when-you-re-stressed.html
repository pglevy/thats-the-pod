(Founders #251)</p><p>(13:30) When you reach a large goal or finally get to the top, the distractions and new assumptions can be dizzying. First comes heightened confidence, followed quickly by overconfidence, arrogance, and a sense that “we’ve mastered it; we’ve figured it out; we’re golden.” But the gold can tarnish quickly. Mastery requires endless remastery. In fact, I don’t believe there is ever true mastery. It is a process, not a destination. — <a href="https://amzn.to/2S9bIxl">The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership</a> by Bill Walsh.
