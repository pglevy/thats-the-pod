<p><i>Note: This is a rebroadcast.</i></p><p>When most people think about losing weight, they think about the details of a diet plan — what food to eat, how much of it to eat, and when to eat it. What they don't spend enough time working on, are the mental and emotional habits that can sabotage their efforts, regardless of the diet plan they adopt.</p><p>That's why my guest today, despite being a biochemist, has made <i>mindset </i>the foundation of his approach to losing weight. His name is Dr. Trevor Kashey and he's the founder of <a href="https://www.trevorkasheynutrition.com/">Trevor Kashey Nutrition</a> (TKN). We begin our conversation with a thumbnail of Trevor's unique background, which includes earning his first university degree in biochemistry at the age of 17, setting national records in powerlifting, and coaching an Olympic fight team, as well as how he went from coaching elite athletes to helping average folks lose weight. We then talk about why Trevor focuses on bridging the gap between knowledge and action, and the erroneous assumptions people make that keep them from following through on their intentions. From there we turn to the phases TKN takes its clients through, which begins with getting what Trevor calls "food clarity." We discuss how simply tracking what you eat can get you to naturally change your diet because of something called "the Hawthorne effect," and can almost be all you need to do to start losing weight. We then get into how to deal with your hunger when you're cutting calories, and why it's crucial to be decisive about it. We also discuss how you can eventually eat more once you work on eating less, how to manage the expectation of consistent weight loss, and why you really need to weigh yourself every week.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-708-overcoming-the-comfort-crisis/">AoM Podcast #708: Overcoming the Comfort Crisis </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/most-sustainable-diet/">AoM Podcast #715: What's the Most Sustainable Diet?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off/">AoM Podcast #475: How to Lose Weight, and Keep It Off Forever </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-track-macros/">AoM article on how to track your food intake</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/6-ways-to-measure-your-body-fat/">AoM Article: 6 Ways to Measure Your Body Fat</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">The Hawthorne effect</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/willpower/">AoM series on willpower</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Dr. Trevor Kashey</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.trevorkasheynutrition.com">Trevor Kashey Nutrition: TKN</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/drkashey/?hl=en">Trevor on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheBESTNutritionGroupEVER/">The Best Nutrition Group EVER on FB</a></li></ul>
