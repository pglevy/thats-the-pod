<p>Why are so many social, business, and classroom interactions so dang dull? This state of affairs isn't only a bummer for those on the receiving end of these underwhelming experiences, but those offering them, too. It means that people are failing to connect with others, teachers are failing to impart knowledge, and salespeople are failing to make sales. Because when you don't engage people, you don't influence them.</p><p>My guest says that the secret to making an impact on others is learning to turn ordinary experiences into extraordinary ones through the science of immersion. Dr. Paul Zak is a professor, scientist, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3uJFU5e"><i>Immersion</i></a>. Today on the show, Paul shares what he's learned from decades of neuroscience research on how to create immersive experiences that will set you apart as an individual or business and increase your influence. We discuss the elements that create immersion, what goes on in the brain when it occurs, how long it can last, and how to induce immersion, whether you want to teach a more engaging class, wow your customers, or simply make everyday interactions with friends and family more memorable.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin?language=en" target="_blank">Paul's TED Talk: Trust, Morality — and Oxytocin?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/3-simple-steps-to-telling-a-great-story-book-giveaway/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 3 Simple Steps to Telling a Great Story</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/how-to-tell-better-stories/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast: #462: How to Tell Better Stories</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6T6YrPA4aM&t=58s" target="_blank">Diet Coke Super Bowl Commercial 2018</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Paul Zak</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://pauljzak.com/" target="_blank">Paul's website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.getimmersion.com/" target="_blank">Immersion website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/paul-zak/" target="_blank">Paul's faculty page</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/12/51PzdM-grL._SL1360_.jpg" alt="" />
