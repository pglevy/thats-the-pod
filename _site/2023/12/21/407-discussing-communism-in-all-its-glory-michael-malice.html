<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with author and podcaster, Michael Malice. They discuss his latest book, “The White Pill.” From this they explore the philosophy of Ayn Rand, anarchism, the history and rebranded atrocities of Czarist Russia, and why utopian visions cyclically entice generations of people, despite leaving each one devastated for their commitment.</p><p> </p><p>Michael Malice is the author of “Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il” and The New Right: A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics,” “The White Pill,” and organizer of “The Anarchist Handbook.” He is also the subject of the graphic novel “Ego & Hubris,” written by the late Harvey Pekar of American Splendor fame. He is the host of “YOUR WELCOME” with Michael Malice. Malice has co-authored books with several prominent personalities, including “Made in America” (the New York Times best selling autobiography of UFC Hall of Famer Matt Hughes), “Concierge Confidential” (one of NPR’s top 5 celebrity books of the year), and “Black Man, White House” (comedian D. L. Hughley’s satirical look at the Obama years, a New York Times best seller). He is also the founding editor of “Overheard in New York.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Michael Malice:</p><p> </p><p>The White Pill (Book) https://www.amazon.com/White-Pill-Tale-Good-Evil/dp/B0BNZ7XZ5T/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1703176917&sr=1-1</p><p> </p><p>On X twitter.com/michaelmalice</p><p> </p><p>On Locals Malice.locals.com</p><p> </p><p>On Youtube https://www.youtube.com/michaelmaliceofficial</p><p> </p>
