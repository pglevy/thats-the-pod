<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with public speaker and mental health advocate Aaron Stark. You might recognize Aaron’s name from his deeply impactful TED Talk, “I was almost a school shooter.” They walk through his life story and discuss the all-too-real result of deep parental trauma, the psychology of abuse that shapes self loathing and self harm, the drivers that nearly pushed Aaron from victim into monster, and the real, tangible act of kindness that saved lives.</p><p> </p><p>Aaron Stark was almost a school shooter. As a dark and destructive teen, Stark almost committed a terrible attack. Today he is a happy father of four, and he wants to do all he can to help anyone on that path to find a way into the light again and to see that they matter.</p><p> </p><p>After watching the news coverage of the Parkland school shootings, Stark wrote an open letter, “I was almost a school shooter.” This was sent to local news 9KUSA in Denver and was the feature story on “Next with Kyle Clark.” This story gained national attention and over 17 million views in a very short time, which propelled him into a life of activism for mental wellness awareness. He has been featured on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and has published an article in the Washington Post. These features were followed by his viral TEDx talk, “I Was Almost a School Shooter” that currently has over 14 million views and is shown in schools, colleges, and universities, all the way up to the Dept. of Education.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Aaron Stark:</p><p> </p><p>Instagram https://instagram.com/aarongstark79?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==</p><p> </p><p>Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aaron.stark1313?mibextid=eHce3h</p><p> </p><p>Youtube https://youtube.com/@aaronstarkauthor?si=1uJFYkVDysFuWETz</p>
