She is also an acclaimed author, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saveyourcity.ca/speaker">speaker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saveyourcity.ca/coaching">coach</a>.

This is through rational discourse, not through factualism, ad hominin attacks, or rage-farming—which are mistaken by our society as rational strategies. </p><p>* 81% of local government US officials have experienced everything from death threats to vandalization of their homes and other forms of abuse. This is the level of government that is closest to the people. So, that very proximity that we need, in a toxic environment, has the capacity to do enormous harm. </p><p>* Aristotle would challenge the view that local government exists to provide city services (or some quality affordable civic services). He would say that civic leadership must be people-centered, namely to achieve <em>eudaimonia</em> as a collective. </p><p>* “Educate the people or endure them.” —Marcus Aurelius</p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Plato's Academy Centre Newsletter at <a href="https://platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTE5ODY2NiwiaWF0IjoxNzA4ODEzNjg0LCJleHAiOjE3MTE0MDU2ODQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTk0NTEyIiwic3ViIjoiY2hlY2tvdXQifQ.QdqKQ1AQPgQuHBFPNKca8knjaFks9LaMNi9uWTqWJNM&#38;utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe</a>
