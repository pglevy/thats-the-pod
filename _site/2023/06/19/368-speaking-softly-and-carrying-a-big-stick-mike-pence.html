<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and former Vice President Mike Pence discuss his current run for the 2024 presidency, the U.S. Government's overreach in economic matters when it should be playing referee, the indoctrination and sexualization of our youngest citizens, the realistic way forward on the Russia Ukraine front, and how we might finally stabilize a nation wrought with cultural warfare.</p><p> </p><p>Mike Pence, an American politician and native Hoosier, served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Before this he practiced private law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and hosted “The Mike Pence Show,” a syndicated talk radio show that also aired as a public affairs program on TV once a week. He only recently announced his candidacy for President of the United States, and is currently on the campaign trail.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Former VP Mike Pence:</p><p> </p><p>Campaign website https://winred.mikepence2024.com/mike-pence-for-president/endorse-mike-pence-gs/?utm_campaign=20230607_RW-PV.102976_t1349066-2833&ex_tid=20230607_RW-PV.102976_t1349066-2833&gclid=CjwKCAjw-b-kBhB-EiwA4fvKrP2mG12lObSBqxgeGAXKK6T6PGsZXmG_d9X88hMeyqV4dFtezETfyRoCpsoQAvD_BwE</p><p> </p><p>Twitter @Mike_Pence https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor </p>
