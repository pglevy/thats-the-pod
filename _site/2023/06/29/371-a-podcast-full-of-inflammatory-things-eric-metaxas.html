<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Eric Metaxas discuss his most recent book, “A Letter to the American Church,” which argues a betrayal of faith by those who stay silent in the face of tyranny. They parallel the arbiters of speech across history against those populating today, and detail the responsibility to act against falsehood that is intrinsically present in the Abrahamic tradition, yet increasingly absent in the American church today.</p><p> </p><p>Eric Metaxas is an American author, speaker, and radio host. He has written award winning biographies, such as “Bonhoeffer,” as well as children's books like “Squanto and the Miracle of Thanksgiving,” Metaxas hosts Socrates in the City,  a recurring popular event where he interviews writers and thinkers on theology, moralism, and philosophy. He also hosts the nationally syndicated Eric Metaxas Show, more broadly referred to as “The Show About Everything.”</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Eric Metaxas:</p><p> </p><p>Website ericmetaxas.com</p><p> </p><p>Socrates In the City (Event) socratesinthecity.com</p><p> </p><p>A Letter to the American Church (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Letter-American-Church-Eric-Metaxas/dp/1684513898/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=602214623177&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9013184&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=452474498154066228&hvtargid=kwd-1664146320895&hydadcr=7659_11327319&keywords=letter+to+the+american+church&qid=1688062525&sr=8-1</p><p> </p><p>Twitter @Ericmetaxas https://twitter.com/ericmetaxas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p> </p>
