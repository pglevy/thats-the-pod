<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/larry-gagosian-profile">How Larry Gagosian Reshaped The Art World</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>(4:00) The dealer has been so successful selling art to masters of the universe that he has become one of them.</p><p>(5:45) We think of genius as being complicated, but geniuses have the fewest moving parts. Gagosian is simple. He's basically a shark, a feeding machine.</p><p>(6:00) A novice is easily spotted because they do too much. Too many ingredients, too many movements. Too much explanation. A master uses the fewest motions required to fulfill their intention.</p><p>(10:00) His own publicist described him as “A Real Killer”</p><p>(12:00) <a href="https://amzn.to/3xTOvkf">The Invisible Billionaire: Daniel Ludwig</a> by Jerry Shields. (Founders #292)</p><p>(17:30) There is always a blueprint. Joseph Duveen was the art dealer to the Robber Barons. </p><p>Biographies of Duveen:</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3tRqefP">Duveen: A Life in Art</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3sbw0Zb">Secrets Of An Art Dealer</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/49b7UOV">Duveen</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/40f28aQ">The Artful Partners: The Secret Association of Bernard Berenson and Joseph Duveen</a></p><p>(18:00) Numerous friends of Gagosian caution me not to mistake this merry-go-round of parties and galas and super yacht cruises for a life of leisure. This guy is always working. This motherfucker works 24/7. The parties are marketing showcases in disguise.</p><p>(19:00) <a href="https://amzn.to/3nsC9O4">The Taste of Luxury: Bernard Arnault and the Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton Story</a> by Nadege Forestier and Nazanine Ravai. (Founders #296)</p><p>(19:30) The best way to raise the price of something is to say that you would never sell it.</p><p>(23:00) If Gagosian possesses one secret weapon that has equipped him for success it might be his disinhibition.</p><p>(33:00) The niche Gagosian pursued was seen —at the time —as low status. The secondary business was perceived as a backwater by dealers. It was considered a bit distasteful.</p><p>(42:00) He disdains formal meetings. He finds bureaucracy and protocol dull. There is no hierarchy. There is Larry and then everyone else.</p><p>(44:00) Gagosian reaps huge profits from asymmetries of information.</p><p>(51:00) Art is just money on the walls.</p><p>(54:00) David Geffen is still as liquid as the day is long.</p><p>(56:00) The competitive drive of self-made billionaires does not go into remission once they’ve made their fortune.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested, so my poor wallet suffers</i>.” — Gareth</p><p>Be like Gareth.
