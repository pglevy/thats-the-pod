<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with author, journalist, and political commentator Glenn Greenwald. They discuss the war on information: how social moralism, religious rhetoric, conceptual safety, and false compassion have been used and propagandized to reshape the western world into a good versus bad, red versus blue polarity. They also explore the human need for meta narratives, the basis of morality, and the case for God in a world that offers nihilism.</p><p> </p><p>​​Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, author, and former constitutional law attorney. His original hit blog was a springboard into writing for Salon and the Guardian with a focus on national security issues. In 2013, he published the now iconic Snowden documents detailing global government surveillance by the U.S. and British governments. In 2019 Greenwald again broke leaked documents, this time for “Operation Car Wash,” which shone a spotlight on the corruption of the Brazilian judicial system. He would later detail his work in a series of books such as Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Brazil and No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State.</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Glenn Greenwald:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/ggreenwald?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p> </p><p>Watch System Update on youtube https://www.youtube.com/@GlennGreenwald </p>
