They discuss his early career both in journalism and professional basketball, his time in the U.S.S.R. learning Russian and publishing a successful gonzo-inspired newspaper, and his breaking coverage of the subprime mortgage bubble. They also examine the state of the world today with Russia and the U.S. military industrial complex, the upcoming presidential election, and the dire necessity for alternative news sources.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Matt Taibbi is an award-winning investigative reporter and one of America’s more recognizable literary voices.  In 2002, Taibbi began work as a contributing editor for Rolling Stone.
