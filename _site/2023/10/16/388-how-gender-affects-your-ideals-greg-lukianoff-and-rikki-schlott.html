<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott to discuss the inception of their new book, “The Canceling of the American Mind,” which seeks to assess cancel culture as it harshly affects American universities and institutions. They also break down the differences between feminine and masculine tendencies in regards to free speech, the entirely real and yet rarely discussed toxic femininity, and why we must prioritize a cultural shift away from the ease of victimhood.</p><p>Greg Lukianoff is a journalist, producer, attorney, New York Times bestselling author, and the president and CEO of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), which is the nation's leading defender of fundamental rights on college campuses. In 2022, FIRE announced they would expand their coverage to fundamental rights off-campus as well, and at this time added “Expression” to their name and mission statement.</p><p>Rikki Schlott is a New York City-based journalist and political commentator. She is a former research fellow at FIRE, host of the <i>Lost Debate </i>podcast, a columnist at the <i>New York Post</i>, and a regular contributor to numerous publications and television programs. Her commentary focuses on free speech, campus culture, civil liberties, and youth issues from a Generation Z perspective.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>“The Canceling of the American Mind” (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Canceling-American-Mind-Undermines-Threatens/dp/1668019140/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KWJ4S9GF9BI0&keywords=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind&qid=1697485877&sprefix=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1</p><p> </p><p>For Greg Lukianoff:</p><p> </p><p>FIRE Website https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/greg-lukianoff</p><p>On Twitter https://twitter.com/glukianoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p>On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/glukianoff/?hl=en</p><p>On Substack https://greglukianoff.substack.com/</p><p> </p><p>For Rikki Schlott:</p><p> </p><p>Website https://www.rikkischlott.com</p><p>On Twitter  https://twitter.com/rikkischlott</p><p>On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/rikkischlott/</p><p>On Substack rikkischlott.substack.com</p>
