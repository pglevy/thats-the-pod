<p>Protein, along with fat and carbohydrates, make up one of three basic macronutrients of the human diet. Yet for something so fundamental, a lot of confusion exists around protein. What's the best kind? How much do you need? When should you eat it?</p><p>Here to clear up some of that confusion is Don Layman, professor emeritus of nutrition and one of the world's foremost researchers on the subject of dietary protein. Today on the show, Don explains why animal-based proteins are superior to plant-based proteins, why he thinks collagen is worthless, how much protein you really need to consume and whether it depends on your activity level and age, what happens when kids don't get enough protein, the optimal times of day to eat protein, who needs to consume protein right after a workout and who doesn't, and whether you can get enough protein in your diet if you do intermittent fasting. We end our conversation with why Don thinks increasing protein consumption can be the most effective way to lose weight.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/chugging-your-protein-its-whey-easier-than-you-think/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Chugging Your Protein — It’s Whey Easier Than You Think</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How Much Protein Do You REALLY Need?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/pre-and-post-workout-nutrition/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Finally Nail Your Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_leverage_hypothesis" target="_blank">Protein leverage hypothesis</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Q4FI7u" target="_blank"><i>Forever Strong: A New, Science-Based Strategy for Aging Well</i></a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Donald Layman</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/donlayman?lang=en" target="_blank">Don on X</a></li><li><a href="https://metabolictransformation.com/" target="_blank">Metabolic Transformation website</a></li><li><a href="https://fshn.illinois.edu/directory/dlayman" target="_blank">Don's faculty page</a></li></ul>
