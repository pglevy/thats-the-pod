<p>If you've wanted to develop your character, you've probably thought about strengthening virtues like courage, humility, and resolution. But my guest would say that practicing social skills is another way of increasing your moral strength, and the moral strength of society as a whole.</p><p>David Brooks is the author of numerous books, including his latest, <a href="https://amzn.to/3SbKcMs"><i>How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen</i></a>. Today on the show, David discusses why our culture lost an emphasis on moral formation, and why this loss has led to alienation and anomie. We then talk about the role each of us can play in repairing this fabric by developing concrete social skills, avenues to improve character that, unlike some virtues that are only called upon in a crisis, you can practice every day. David shares insights on how we can get better at giving people attention, asking good questions, and helping those who are going through a hard time. We also discuss how understanding different personality types and life stages can allow us to better understand other people.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>David's previous appearances on the AoM Podcast:<ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-292-road-character/" target="_blank">Episode #292: The Road to Character</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/david-brooks-second-mountain/" target="_blank">Episode #518: The Quest for a Moral Life</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/" target="_blank">"How America Got Mean" — <i>Atlantic</i> article by David Brooks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/how-to-listen-effectively/" target="_blank">AoM series on becoming a better listener</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/10-ways-to-help-a-grieving-friend/" target="_blank">AoM excerpt: 10 Ways to Help a Grieving Friend</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/the-3-elements-of-charisma-presence/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The 3 Elements of Charisma — Presence</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/the-stages-of-a-mans-life/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Stages of a Man’s Life </a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/10/A1zNa2Da9WL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
