<p>Victor Haghani and James White are co-authors of "The Missing Billionaires, A Guide to Better Financial Decisions." Victor is also the founder and CIO of Elm Wealth and David is the CEO, where they implement these concepts for their clients. This fascinating book discusses investment decision-making and risk-sizing and how to make better financial decisions with your wealth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Markets have behaved very well for 100 years, resulting in real profits for investors. However, few rich families from the early 1900s have been able to retain their wealth despite exceptional returns in the markets. The problem isn’t that people make poor decisions about what to invest in, they make poor “risk decisions” about how much risk to take and when to take it.</p>
