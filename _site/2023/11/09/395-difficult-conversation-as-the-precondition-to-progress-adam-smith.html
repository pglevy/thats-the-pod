<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with lawyer, state representative, and author Adam Smith. They discuss his new book “Lost and Broken: My Journey Back from Chronic Pain and Crippling Anxiety.” From this they explore the differences between cognitive and behavioral therapy, the dogmatization of nuance, the rise of “harm reduction” in the current era of identity politics, and the ideal goal of argument: it’s much more than just scoring points.</p><p> </p><p>Congressman Adam Smith is an American lawyer and politician, having served in the Washington state senate from 1991 to 97. His new book, “Lost and Broken: My Journey Back from Chronic Pain and Crippling Anxiety,”  has just recently been released.</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Adam Smith:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/electadamsmith?lang=en</p><p> </p><p>Lost and Broken (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Broken-Journey-Chronic-Crippling-ebook/dp/B0B3YC7KLJ </p>
