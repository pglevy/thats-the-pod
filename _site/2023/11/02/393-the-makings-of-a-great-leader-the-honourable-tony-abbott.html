<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Australian journalist and former prime minister, the Honourable Tony Abbott. They discuss Australia’s role on the world stage, the problems facing their economy and culture, how the quasi-cult of carbon threatens the developing world, why new religions propagate where faith has been abdicated, and the looming threat of war as China destabilizes while Putin pushes forward against Ukraine.</p><p> </p><p>Tony Abbott was elected prime minister by the Australian people on September 7, 2013, and served for two years. In that time, the carbon tax and mining tax were repealed, free trade agreements were finalized with China, Japan and Korea; the people smuggling trade from Indonesia to Australia were halted, and Australia became the second largest military contributor to the US-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. Currently, he is a director of the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation, serves on the council of the Australian War Memorial, and is an adviser to the UK Board of Trade. He’s patron to several charities, including Soldier On, the International Sports Promotion Society, and Worldwide Support for Development.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For The Honourable Tony Abbott</p><p> </p><p>Website https://tonyabbott.com.au/</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/hontonyabbott?lang=en </p>
