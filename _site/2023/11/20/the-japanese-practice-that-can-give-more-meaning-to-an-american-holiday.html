<p>A focus on gratitude is typical this time of year. But more often than not, the cognitive or behavioral nods we give gratitude around Thanksgiving can feel a little limp, rote, and unedifying. If you feel like this American holiday has been lacking in meaning, maybe what you need is to infuse it with a Japanese practice.</p><p>The Naikan method of self-reflection grew out of Buddhist spirituality and has been recognized by psychologists as a way to develop greater self-awareness, gratitude, empathy, and direction. Naikan involves asking yourself three questions: What have I received from others? What have I given others? What troubles and difficulties have I caused others?</p><p>Gregg Krech, who is the executive director of the ToDo Institute, which promotes principles of psychology based on Eastern traditions, has created a Thanksgiving-specific version of Naikan that helps practitioners dig further into its first question. Today on the show, we talk about the way Naikan differs from mainstream gratitude practices and is based less on feeling and more on seeing the world objectively. Gregg shares six prompts that can help you recognize the reality of how you're being supported in the world, cultivate the art of noticing, and embrace life's grace.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.thirtythousanddays.org/guide-to-gratitude-grace-thanksgiving-reflection/" target="_blank">The ToDo Institute's free Thanksgiving Guide to Self-Reflection booklet</a> — scroll down, enter your email into the form, and a PDF of the booklet will be sent to you.</li><li>Gregg's previous appearances on the AoM podcast:<ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-425-action-over-feelings/" target="_blank">#425: Action Over Feelings</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/new-years-reflection-questions/" target="_blank"> #671: Begin the New Year by Reflecting on These 3 Life-Changing Questions</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3QYNH7P" target="_blank"><i>Naikan: Gratitude, Grace, and the Japanese Art of Self-Reflection </i>by Gregg Krech</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-906-stop-being-a-complainer/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #906: Stop Being a Complainer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/spiritual-disciplines-gratitude/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Spiritual Disciplines — Gratitude </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/sunday-firesides-graduate-from-the-kindergarten-class-of-gratitude/" target="_blank">Sunday Firesides: Graduate From the Kindergarten Class of Gratitude</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/how-to-cultivate-gratitude-thankfulness/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #459: Beyond Gratitude Lite — The Real Virtue of Thankfulness</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/how-to-develop-gratitude-in-your-kids/" target="_blank">How to Fight Entitlement and Develop Gratitude in Your Kids</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/the-george-bailey-technique/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The George Bailey Technique — Mentally Erase Your Blessings for Greater Joy and Optimism</a></li></ul><h2>Connect with Gregg Krech</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.thirtythousanddays.org/" target="_blank">Thirty Thousand Days Website</a></li></ul>
