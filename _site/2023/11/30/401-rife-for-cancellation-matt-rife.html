<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down in-person with recently “canceled” comedian Matt Rife. They discuss the incident in question, his viral response, the prominence of crowd work in his act, his early career start at the age of 15, the innovative use of social media to build his name, and the real reason he remains unapologetic for having a sense of humor.</p><p> </p><p>Matthew Steven Rife was born in 1995 and is an American stand up comedian and actor. He started early, entering a school talent show at the age of 14 after being encouraged by a friend. Finding this to be a success, he went professional the next year at age 15. Using TikTok, he managed to consistently go viral with his stand up and "red flag" crowd work. He then entered the arena full time, using social media to grow his name before producing three straight-to-YouTube comedy specials from 2021 to 2023. This year, he debuted his first Netflix special, "Natural Selection."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Matt Rife:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://x.com/mattrife?s=20</p><p> </p><p>On Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mKA8JTOCeodl9bEK7w42Q</p><p> </p><p>On Tiktok https://www.tiktok.com/@matt_rife?lang=en</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Full Specials:</p><p> </p><p>“Only Fans” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzgFwZEAHZQ</p><p> </p><p>“Matthew Steven Rife” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AwsR1iqsuE</p><p> </p><p>“Walking Red Flag”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HkmMXprPwI&t=768s</p><p> </p><p>Watch “Natural Selection” on Netflix now!</p>
