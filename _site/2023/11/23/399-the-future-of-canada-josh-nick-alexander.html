<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Save Canada organizers Josh and Nick Alexander. They discuss the resurgence of activism for christian ideals and family values, the abhorrent response from administrative bodies, mainstream media, and law enforcement, the threats and physical violence levied against their family and organization, and what their battle really means for Canada and the world at large.</p><p> </p><p>Josh Alexander is a 17 year old Christian student activist. Josh has been denied an education at the Renfrew County Catholic District School Board since November 2022, after speaking out against the radical left wing gender ideology in schools. After three arrests since February, one having been at his highschool, Josh has continued to publicly uphold his convictions in the face of the rapidly developing censorious state.</p><p> </p><p>Nick Alexander is the older brother of Josh Alexander. He has been arrested 3 times and removed from his fire department for exercising his rights to oppose the mainstream narrative. Nick recently made headlines after being assaulted with an edged weapon by union supported counter protestors and then arrested.</p><p>Together Josh and Nick lead the Save Canada movement as it sweeps the country bringing the message of truth to our youth and providing a rallying point for concerned citizens.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Josh and Nick Alexander:</p><p> </p><p>Josh's X:</p><p>https://x.com/officialJosh_A?t=qZoEDTEB1j3Q-U1OfPUnJA&s=09</p><p> </p><p>Nick's X:</p><p>https://x.com/Nick_SaveCanada?t=VjnOg0J9wS3no8plwh-QXg&s=09</p><p> </p><p>Josh's Instagram:</p><p>https://instagram.com/josh.alexander_savecanada?igshid=NzZlODBkYWE4Ng==</p><p> </p><p>Nick's Instagram:</p><p>https://instagram.com/nick.alexander_savecanada?igshid=NzZlODBkYWE4Ng==</p><p> </p><p>Save Canada website: https://savecanada.shop/</p><p> </p>
