<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with mathematician, author, and theologian Dr. John Lennox. They discuss the axioms and dangerous aims of transhumanism, the interplay between ethical faith, reason, and the empirical world, that makes up the scientific endeavor, and the line between luciferian intellectual presumption and wise courageous exploration.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. John Carson Lennox is a ​​Northern Irish mathematician, bioethicist, and Christian apologist. He has written several books (Below), and was a professor at Oxford and Green Templeton College (Now retired) where he specialized in group theory. Lennox appeared in numerous debates with questions ranging from “Is God Good” to “Is There a God,” and faced off with academic titans such as Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, and Christopher Hitchens, among others. Lennox speaks four languages – English, German, French, and Russian, has written 70 peer-reviewed articles on mathematics, co-authored two Oxford Mathematical Monographs, and was noted for his role in translating Russian mathematics while working as a professor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Dr. John Lennox:</p><p> </p><p>Website https://www.johnlennox.org/</p><p> </p><p>The Oxford Center For Christian Apologetics https://www.theocca.org/  </p><p> </p><p>The Veritas Forum https://www.veritas.org/ </p>
