When they work together it becomes stronger. And as a result of what she created, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>(53:30) The power she has cannot be understated. The way in which she accumulated the power was fascinating. She aligned everybody's interest, with her at the center.</p><p>(1:05:00) She's not just building up a personal brand.
