<p>Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with the current president of the Heritage Foundation, Dr. Kevin Roberts. They discuss the operations and practical utility of think tanks, the state of progressivism across academia, how multiple generations of students are now incapable of facing adversity, while claiming to fight it, and why intellectual combat is not something to shut down, but to champion against dire falsehoods.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Kevin Roberts is the current and 7th president of the Heritage Foundation (granted the role in 2021), an American Conservative think tank tackling issues on border control, immigration, inflation, among many other policy driven topics. He received his PhD in History from the University of Texas. After this, he taught history for a number of years. Then, in 2006 he founded the John Paul The Great Academy, a co-ed, K-12 Catholic liberal arts school in Lafayette, Louisiana. He was president for 7 years before resigning in order to become president of the Wyoming Catholic College.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Kevin Roberts:</p><p> </p><p>Follow Dr. Kevin Roberts on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KevinRobertsTX</p><p> </p><p>Watch The Kevin Roberts Show: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBs6_t5NjudTqHeZr4FImBukCe437Huo7</p><p> </p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kevin-roberts-show/id1609468507?utm_medium=social&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=thf-yt</p><p> </p><p>Visit Heritage online: www.Heritage.org</p><p> </p><p>Follow The Heritage Foundation on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation/</p><p> </p><p>Follow The Heritage Foundation on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Heritage </p>
