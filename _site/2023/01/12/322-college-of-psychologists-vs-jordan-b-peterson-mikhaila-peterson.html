<p>Dr Jordan B Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila Peterson explain the current situation with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. They have presented Dr. Peterson with an ultimatum- take part in re-education courses aiming to correct his “wrongthink”, or lose his clinical psychology license. This is unprecedented, totally unjust, and will not be taken lying down.</p><p> </p><p>Mikhaila Peterson is a CEO and the host of “The Mikhaila Peterson Podcast.” As well as interviews, she hosts a series called Opposing Views, where she speaks to people with differing opinions on contentious issues to let listeners make up their own minds. She’s used a diet called the Lion Diet to heal from autoimmune and mood disorders and has educated people on that diet via TEDx and Oxford Union speeches.</p><p> </p><p>Mikhaila is also the founder of the upcoming online education platform Peterson Academy, an online education place devoid of ideology, launching in 2023.</p>
