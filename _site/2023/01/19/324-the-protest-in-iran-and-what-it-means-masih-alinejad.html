<p>Dr Jordan B Peterson and Masih Alinejad discuss the current situation in Iran, the growing unrest as revolution beckons, and the need for support from the world stage. Alinejad recounts her personal experiences growing up in Iran, being exiled, and multiple kidnapping attempts orchestrated by the current regime.</p><p>Masih Alinejad is an Iranian-American journalist, author, and women's rights activist. Alinejad is an outspoken critic of the Iranian government’s human rights abuses and its treatment of women and political opponents. She is the founder of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign against compulsory hijab. Since its launch in 2014 has become the largest civil disobedience campaign for women’s rights in the history of the Islamic Republic. Alinejad currently lives in exile in New York City under FBI protection since a coordinated kidnapping attempt by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Intelligence Ministry was foiled in 2021. </p>
