<p>In my twenties and early thirties, I was a regular journaler. Several years ago, however, I stopped journaling almost entirely because I wasn't getting anything out of it anymore. But my guest has helped me see that my problem wasn't with journaling itself, but that I had gotten into a journaling rut, and he's introduced me to some new ways to journal that have inspired me to get back into the practice. </p><p>Campbell Walker is an illustrator, animator, podcaster, and YouTuber, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3jRdOPQ"><i>Your Head is a Houseboat: A Chaotic Guide to Mental Clarity</i></a>. Today on the show, Cam shares how journaling transformed his life and what it can do for yours. We discuss why it's helpful to do a journaling brain dump and how to then move beyond that to incorporate different techniques that will help you get greater insight into the problems you're facing and how to solve them. We unpack those techniques, which include how to journal to break mindset, conduct a lifestyle and habits audit, and quell anxiety. We also talk about an experiment Cam did where he only used the social media apps on his phone when he was posting something, and every time he got the itch to check social media for fun, he engaged in something he calls "microjournaling" instead. We end our conversation with how Cam's journaling changed after he became a dad and his tips on making journaling a consistent habit in your life.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dArgOrm98Bk" target="_blank">Campbell's Video: The Journaling Techniques That Changed My Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFvdHfhVIsQ" target="_blank">Campbell's Video: I Replaced Social Media With Micro-Journaling for 1 Year</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-journal/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Right and Wrong Way to Journal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/why-i-stopped-journaling/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Why I Stopped Journaling</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-8-start-a-journal/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 30 Days to a Better Man Day 8 — Start a Journal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Jumpstart Your Journaling — A 31-Day Challenge</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/31-days-greater-self-reliance/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 31 Journaling Prompts for Building Greater Self-Reliance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/building-your-resiliency-part-vi-quit-catastrophizing/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Quit Catastrophizing </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/how-to-make-better-decisions/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #387: Think Like a Poker Player to Make Better Decisions (With Annie Duke)</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Campbell Walker (AKA "Struthless")</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/struthless" target="_blank">Cam on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/struthless69/" target="_blank">Cam on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://struthless.com/" target="_blank">The Struthless Shop Website</a></li><li><a href="https://struthlessstudios.com/" target="_blank">The Struthless Animation Studio Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/01/your-head-is-a-houseboat.jpg" alt="" />
