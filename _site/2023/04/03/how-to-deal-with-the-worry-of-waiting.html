<p>If you've ever waited, and perhaps are now currently waiting, to hear whether or not you've tested positive for a disease, passed medical boards, or got the job you interviewed for, you know that this period of uncertainty can be filled with tension and anxiety.</p><p>My guest today — Kate Sweeny, a professor of psychology — has studied the dynamics of this human experience and how we can best deal with it. We first discuss why the stress of waiting for uncertain news feels particularly uncomfortable and what types of people are more likely to worry while waiting. Kate then shares tactics that can help alleviate some of the worry of waiting, including leaning into being a pessimist as you approach the moment of truth and finding flow, even by doing something like playing Tetris. She also explains at what point the social support for people who are waiting for news tends to wane, so you can better support those around you who are currently stuck in this state of mind-burdening limbo.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/5-tools-for-thriving-in-uncertainty/">5 Tools for Thriving in Uncertainty</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/the-best-books-to-read-in-uncertain-times/">The Best Books to Read in Uncertain Times</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/live-life-at-the-limits-how-to-hack-your-flow/">AoM Podcast #287: The New Frontier of Flow</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/dont-ask-why/">The One Question NOT to Ask for Healthy Introspection (And What to Ask Instead)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-journal/">The Right and Wrong Way to Journal</a></li></ul><h2>Connect with Kate Sweeny</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.katesweeny.com/" target="_blank">Kate's website </a></li></ul>
