<p>You know Michael Phelps, the most successful and decorated Olympic swimmer of all time who won a record 28 medals, 23 of which were gold.</p><p>Well today, meet the coach behind Phelps' legendary success. Bob Bowman is an Olympic swimming coach, the head coach of the Arizona State swim team, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3MB49t1"><i>The Golden Rules: 10 Steps to World-Class Excellence in Your Life and Work</i></a>. Today on the show, Bob shares what he calls "the method," a system of principles he's developed over the years to coach his athletes to elite-level success that can also be applied to setting and achieving goals in every area of life. We first talk about how Bob ended up working with Phelps, before turning to some of his golden rules. We discuss developing a "dream big vision" and all-in attitude; the importance of having a daily routine and what his own routine and the routine of his swimmers is like; the need to cultivate a passion outside your main pursuit; and much more.</p><p>After the show is over, check out the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/goldenrules" target="_blank">aom.is/goldenrules</a></p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/create-a-life-plan/">AoM Article: Craft the Life You Want â€” Creating a Blueprint for Your Future</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/visions-over-goals/">AoM Article: Visions Over Goals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/motivation-over-discipline/">AoM Article: Motivation Over Discipline</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/get-1-better-every-day-the-kaizen-way-to-self-improvement/">AoM Article: Get 1% Better Every Day</a></li><li><a href="https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers">"The Mundanity of Excellence" by Daniel F.
