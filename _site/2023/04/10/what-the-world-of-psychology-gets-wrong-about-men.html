<p>Several years ago, the American Psychological Association issued a set of guidelines for psychologists working with boys and men. Guideline #1 says: "Psychologists strive to recognize that masculinities are constructed based on social, cultural, and contextual norms." Guideline #3 says: "Psychologists understand the impact of power, privilege, and sexism on the development of boys and men and on their relationships with others."</p><p>My guest says that these guidelines miss the mark, and are just one indicator of the way in which the world of psychology misunderstands, and consequently underserves, men.</p><p>Dr. John Barry is a psychologist, the co-founder of the Male Psychology Section of the British Psychological Society and the Centre for Male Psychology, as well as the co-author of the <a href="https://amzn.to/40VTxcC"><i>Perspectives in Male Psychology</i></a> textbook. Today on the show, John unpacks the issues with thinking that masculinity is purely a social construct and that men's problems grow out of their power and privilege, and how these issues prevent men from getting the help they need. In the second half of our conversation, we discuss the surprising origin of the idea of toxic masculinity, what really defines masculinity, and what effect internalizing a negative or positive view of masculinity has on men. We end our conversation with what works for men's mental health and well-being if you don't want to go to therapy, and what you should look for in a therapist if you do.</p><p>After the show is over, check out the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/malepysch" target="_blank">aom.is/malepysch</a></p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/">The Centre for Male Psychology</a></li><li><a href="https://thecentreformalepsychology.thinkific.com/courses/IntroductiontoMalePsychologyandMentalHealth">Introduction to Male Psychology and Mental Health course</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/the-3-ps-of-manhood-protect/">AoM series on the origins, nature, and imperatives of manhood</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300050763/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300050763"><i>Manhood in the Making</i> by David Gilmore</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3mcBiRd"><i>Iron John</i> by Robert Bly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-testosterone-makes-men-men/">AoM Podcast #761: How Testosterone Makes Men, Men</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy">Rational emotive behavior therapy</a></li><li>Men's sheds associations in <a href="https://mensshed.org/about-mens-sheds/what-is-a-mens-shed/">Australia</a> and the <a href="https://usmenssheds.org/">US</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With John Barry</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.johnbarrypsychologist.com/male-psychology-home" target="_blank">John's website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/MalePsychology" target="_blank">JohnÂ on Twitter</a></li></ul>
