<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Senator Mike Lee discuss the ever present conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the  role of the United States in that conflict via proxy war, the rise of ESG investing, why the top investment firms do not care about your values, and what Senator Lee plans to do about it.</p><p> </p><p>Elected in 2010 as Utah's 16th Senator, Mike Lee has spent his career defending the fundamental liberties of all Americans and advocating for America's founding constitutional principles. Senator Lee acquired a deep respect for the Constitution early in life while watching his father, Rex E. Lee, serve as the Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan. He attended most of his father's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, giving him a unique and up-close understanding of our government. Lee graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Political Science, and served as BYU's Student Body President in his senior year. Senator Lee serves as the Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, in addition to serving on the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining and the Committee on the Budget.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Senator Mike Lee:</p><p> </p><p>Senator Lee's website https://www.lee.senate.gov/</p><p> </p><p>Twitter https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p> </p><p>Saving Nine (NEW Book): https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Nine-Against-Audacious-American/dp/1546002200</p>
