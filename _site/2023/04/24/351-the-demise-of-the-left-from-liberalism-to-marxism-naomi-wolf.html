<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Naomi Wolf discuss her original ambitions, the derailment of her scholarly career at the hands of misogyny, her rise to the forefront of third wave feminism as a best-selling author, and how the mainstream turned on her once she wrote on a topic the Left had blacklisted: COVID-19.</p><p> </p><p>Naomi Wolf is an American author and journalist. Her first book, “The Beauty Myth,” would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as “The End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.” In recent years, she has come under fire for being an “anti-vaxer” and a “conspiracy theorist,” which led Wolf to write her most recent book, “The Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Naomi Wolf</p><p> </p><p>The Bodies of Others (Book): https://www.amazon.com/Bodies-Others-Authoritarians-COVID-19-Against/dp/1737478560</p><p> </p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/naomirwolf/?hl=en</p><p> </p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/naomirwolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor </p>
