In war, it is wise to lie and deceive the enemy…The point of war after all is to win by destroying one’s foes,  not to engage in a shared searched for something higher of larger.” </p><p>* “To understand why there is so much anger in our communities, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of those who feel defeated, excluded, cheated, or at risk…What reason do they have to admire their leaders?”</p><p>* “The Stoics believed in the natural equality of all peoples…Zeno defined the city (<em>polis</em>) in such a way as to include any citizen or non-citizen who resided in the place.”</p><p>* “Teach them better and make it appear better to them, but don't you be angry with them.” —Marcus Aurelius</p><p></p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Plato's Academy Centre Newsletter at <a href="https://platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTE5ODY2NiwiaWF0IjoxNzA4ODEzNjg0LCJleHAiOjE3MTE0MDU2ODQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTk0NTEyIiwic3ViIjoiY2hlY2tvdXQifQ.QdqKQ1AQPgQuHBFPNKca8knjaFks9LaMNi9uWTqWJNM&#38;utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe</a>
