<p>When most people think of psychopaths, they think of uniformly monstrous characters who lack empathy and conscience.</p><p>But my guest says that those characteristics are just one part of the spectrum of traits that make up psychopathy, and while always having these traits turned up high is indeed bad, when employed to certain degrees in certain circumstances, they can actually be utilized for adaptive, positive ends.</p><p>Kevin Dutton is a researcher of experimental psychology at Oxford and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3L9i20s"><i>The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success</i></a>. Today on the show, Kevin first defines what makes psychopaths, psychopaths, and how they differ from sociopaths. He describes how psychopathic traits can be particularly useful in some professions and which professions attract the most psychopaths. In the second half of our conversation, Kevin lays out his argument for why he thinks the Apostle Paul was a psychopath and how that’s actually what made him such an effective evangelist. At the end of our conversation, Kevin offers a test that assesses psychopathy; stay tuned to find out if I’m a psychopath and take the test yourself to see if you are.</p><h2>Connect With Kevin Dutton</h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/therealdrkev">Kevin on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/therealdrkev/">Kevin on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.drkevindutton.com/">Kevin’s website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/04/71K8GcDErCL._AC_UF10001000_QL80_.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
