<p>Twenty years ago, it didn't seem like a burdensome task to write a handwritten letter to a loved one. Fifteen years ago, it wasn't a big deal to write a long email to a friend. Today, it can feel hard to motivate yourself to tap out a two line response to a text.</p><p>The feeling that your attention span has been shrinking over time isn't just in your head. Research by today's guest shows that it is empirically getting shorter and shorter.</p><p>Dr. Gloria Mark is the world's preeminent researcher on attention and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/40wQ193"><i>Attention Span</i></a>. If you'd like to get a handle on your diminishing powers of concentration, you have to understand how attention works, and that's what Gloria explains in the first part of our conversation. We then get into how multitasking is like drawing on and wiping off a whiteboard and why it makes us feel so frazzled. Gloria then shares the way that personality influences your attention span, including why people who are more neurotic have the shortest attention spans and why conscientious people may not want to use distraction-blocking apps. We then get into how the internet and the shot lengths of modern movies reinforce our short attention spans. In the last part of our conversation, Gloria makes the case that fighting the hindrances to our attention by trying to be focused all the time isn't possible or desirable, and that our goal should be balanced focus rather than hyper focus. She explains how to achieve that balanced focus by leaning into your unique productivity rhythm, taking breaks without guilt, and developing a sense of agency over your attention.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/become-the-supreme-commander-of-your-mind-how-to-effectively-manage-your-attention/" target="_blank">AoM Article:Â How to Effectively Manage Your Attention</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/your-concentration-training-program-11-exercises-that-will-strengthen-your-attention/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 11 Exercises That Will Strengthen Your Attention</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/how-to-beat-distraction-and-stay-focused/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 12 Concentration Exercises from 1918</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-420-what-makes-your-phone-so-addictive-how-to-take-back-your-life/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #420: What Makes Your Phone So Addictive & How to Take Back Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-553-how-to-become-indistractable/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #553: How to Become Indistractable</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/monotasking-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #768: Become a Focused Monotasker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-832-the-power-of-unwavering-focus/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #832: The Power of Unwavering Focus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y" target="_blank">Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Gloria Mark</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://gloriamark.com/" target="_blank">Gloria's Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/02/9780369733054_1b30aec1-f2fc-4461-8b6d-f9bdd52ad365_1599x.webp" alt="" />
