<p>37signals has undergone some name changes since its inception over 20 years ago: starting as 37signals in 1999, then changing to Basecamp in 2014, before switching back to 37signals in 2022. </p><p><br/></p><p>Today, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson sit down to uncover the story behind the name 37signals, the reasoning behind the name changes, and the impact a name has on a business as we discuss what&apos;s in a name. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>[00:46] - Jason connects extraterrestrial intelligence to the name 37signals.</p><p>[01:56] - The out-of-the-park success that prompted a reassessment of the company&apos;s diversification. </p><p>[04:07] - Do we really need all this? The stress (and necessary decisions) that grew out of success.  </p><p>[05:54] - How pride in their work led Jason and David to downsize their product line. </p><p>[07:56] - Jason shares the behind-the-scenes story of the 2014 meeting that led to sun-setting their other products to focus on Basecamp (which is still in operation after 19 years).</p><p>[10:04] - David shares the lightbulb moment he had during that meeting that prompted him to fully commit to changing the company&apos;s name and business model.</p><p>[12:46] - Too many products, not enough progress. Getting everyone on the same page and figuring out the next steps.</p><p>[14:27] - Same people, same location, NEW NAME (and domain).</p><p>[17:16] - The difficult decision to stop running Highrise.   </p><p>[19:19] - Back to our roots in 2022.</p><p>[21:37] - How having a unified brand name helps maintain a consistent tone and strengthens brand value.</p><p>[23:15] - No need for a lengthy cost-benefit analysis—go with your gut. </p><p>[24:18] - It&apos;s what we want to do, and that&apos;s enough. </p><p>[25:03] - Two products under one umbrella, why returning to a multi-product company name made sense from a company standpoint. </p><p>[25:37] - A brand by any other name—how much does your business name matter? </p><p>[27:34] - Do you have a question for Jason and David or anyone at 37signals?
