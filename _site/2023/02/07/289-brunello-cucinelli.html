Our task is first to discover the nature of our summons, then to follow it.</p><p>[11:00] We schedule time to think. Most people schedule themselves like a dentist. It's so easy to get so busy that you no longer have time to think- and you pay a huge price for that. —— <a href="https://amzn.to/3Wjhw2m">All I Want To Know Is Where I'm Going To Die So I'll Never Go There: Buffett & Munger – A Study in Simplicity and Uncommon, Common Sense</a> by Peter Bevelin. (Founders #286)</p><p>[14:00] Try to be your son's teacher until he's ten years old; his father, until he's twenty; and his friend, for the rest of his life.</p><p>[14:00] The problem is not getting rich, it's staying sane. —Charlie Munger</p><p>[18:00] What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic. —Carl Sagan</p><p>[23:00] Postponing the reward increases the appreciation, a fact that has been forgotten in the current culture of impatience.</p><p>[29:00] I could see the humiliation in my father's eyes. His teary eyes were the source of inspiration for my life.</p><p>[33:00] I have always been firmly convinced that in order to successfully stand out you need to focus on one single project representing the dream of your life.</p><p>[36:00] A young man with no money and tons of enthusiasm.</p><p>[41:00] <a href="https://amzn.to/3YefiTv">Ralph Lauren: The Man Behind the Mystique</a> by Jeffrey Trachtenberg. (Founders #288) </p><p>[43:00] One thing I never did—which I’m really proud of—was to push any of my kids too hard.
