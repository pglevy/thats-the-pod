<p>Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering several benefits, such as increased flexibility and the ability to work anywhere globally. </p><p><br/></p><p>However, there are some challenges that come with remote work and it’s certainly not for all companies. </p><p><br/></p><p>In this episode of the Rework podcast, 37signals co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson discuss these issues and how they&apos;ve overcome them from their book, <a href='https://37signals.com/books/#rework'><em>Rework</em></a>.</p><p><br/></p><p>They share insights on how to work together across different time zones, ways to stay connected while working remotely, and the benefits of remote work for both employees and employers. </p><p><br/></p><p>Listen in to find out what remote work has to offer, along with its challenges and benefits, from two seasoned advocates.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:36] - 37signals is as remote as they&apos;ve ever been. </p><p>[01:02] - The challenges of time zones in a remote work environment, especially when training or mentoring new employees. </p><p>[02:22] - Jason discusses the importance of scheduling and pairing employees with compatible time zones, depending on their experience level. </p><p>[03:57] - David shares why from his perspective, four hours is the ideal amount of time zone overlap for remote collaboration.</p><p>[05:32] - Why it&apos;s essential to be strategic about where you hire from, given the challenges of time zone differences.</p><p>[06:13] - While asynchronous communication is useful, synchronous communication is needed to crack through some tasks.</p><p>[07:52] - How 37signals twice-yearly meetups are more of an investment than an expense, unlike the cost of an office.</p><p>[08:35] - Humans are not built for fully remote work—why meeting in person is necessary to reduce loneliness, recharge batteries, and create better team relationships.</p><p>[10:57] - Why simply installing communication tools like Slack and Zoom without changing work practices offers the worst of both worlds and results in a subpar remote work experience.</p><p>[12:20] - The potential pitfalls and tradeoffs of the new hybrid work model.</p><p>[14:10] - The benefits of being able to hire the best talent from anywhere in the world and allowing employees the freedom to live and work in multiple locations.</p><p>[16:22] - Jason discusses why some companies are requiring employees to return to the office after the pandemic and both advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>[17:46] - David shares why either way is OK—some companies thrive with having an in-person culture catering to the needs of employees who prefer working in an office, while there should be more remote work options for those who prefer working from home.</p><p>[20:38] - Busting the myth that remote work is impossible, creating more options for people, but the future of work remains to be seen.</p><p>[22:39] - Leave a voicemail at 708-628-7850 or <a href='http://rework@37signals.com'>email us</a> with questions for David and Jason about remote work or running a business for a chance to have it answered on an upcoming episode.</p><p><br/><strong>Links and Resources:<br/></strong><br/><a href='https://37signals.com/books/#rework'><em>Rework</em><br/></a>Do you have a question for Jason and David?
