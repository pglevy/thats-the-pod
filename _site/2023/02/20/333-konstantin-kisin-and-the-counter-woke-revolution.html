He is also the author of “An Immigrant's Love Letter to the West,” a Sunday Times Bestseller. He has written for a number of publications including <i>Quillette</i>, <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>Standpoint</i> on issues relating to tech censorship, woke culture, comedy and other topics, but currently publishes articles on his popular Substack.

His speech at the debate received viral attention and has been seen by over 100 million people around the world.</p>
