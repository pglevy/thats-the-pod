The product itself is their design system. </p><p>[03:07] - As with Basecamp and <a href='https://www.hey.com/'>Hey,</a> design consistency can emerge naturally.</p><p>[03:30] - David shares that large organizations typically use design systems to standardize processes. </p><p>[05:34] - Why it makes sense for individual designers to have ownership over the design process for small teams like 37signals.</p><p>[06:52] - Listener Paul asks how David and Jason resolve conflicts and make difficult decisions.</p><p>[07:02] - Jason explains conflicts are rare among the team and shares how they handle the things they don&apos;t agree on (without keeping score). </p><p>[08:18] - Why it&apos;s important to remember most decisions are temporary.  </p><p>[08:59] - Jason shares an example of the rare occurrences when they might battle. [09:49] - Setting the standards for a smooth workflow.</p><p>[11:30] - David&apos;s philosophy: &quot;A willingness to try anything as long as there&apos;s an expiration on the experiment and a way to tell whether it went one way or the other.&quot;</p><p>[12:55] - Jason explains why they don&apos;t need to consult each other for every decision—even the BIG ones, like <a href='https://37signals.com/podcast/leaving-the-cloud/'>leaving the cloud</a>. </p><p>[14:28] - Prioritizing independence, competency, and TRUST.</p><p>[16:50] - Podcast listener Tim asks Jason and David to discuss 37signals&apos; approach to product management and some of their methods over the years.</p><p>[17:20] - David shares how using software to gather and distribute information, allowing teams to make decisions, leads to everyone rowing in the same boat.</p><p>[20:19] - Jason adds that with two-person teams, there is a direct relationship between the programmer and designer, and management would get in the way.</p><p>[22:21] - Fighting hard against traditional managerial responsibilities because having managers invent work for other people can wreck a good thing (David and Jason only wear the hats of CTO and CEO occasionally).</p><p>[23:25] - Do you have questions for David and Jason about a better way to work and run your business?
