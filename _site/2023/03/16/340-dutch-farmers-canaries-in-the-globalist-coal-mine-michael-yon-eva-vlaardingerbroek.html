<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, Michael Yon, and Eva Vlaardingerbroek discuss recent events encircling the Dutch farmers protest, how their anti-globalist movement mirrors the Canadian Freedom Convoy, and how their message has resonated across the world despite best efforts to silence their voices.</p><p> </p><p>At age 19, Michael Yon completed Green Beret training. His Green Beret experience taught him the art of observing and surviving in the most dangerous environments on earth. Combining his skills as a writer and a photographer, and with the encouragement of fellow veterans, Michael began his correspondent career by traveling to Iraq in December of 2004. That was the first step in his nearly 20-year journey—traveling the globe to report on world events firsthand. He has traveled to more than 80 countries including China, India, Bhutan, and Vietnam studying issues from cannibalism, information warfare, insurgency, protests, migration wars, and more.  His most recent journey has taken him from Asia to Europe, America, and Central and South America to study the conditions for global famine.</p><p> </p><p>Eva Vlaardingerbroek is a Dutch journalist and host of the “Let’s Talk About It” program on the YouTube channel Riks. Vlaardingerbroek has published opinion articles in newspapers such as the Dutch weekly and Elsevier Weekblad. She has also appeared on programs like Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News. She advocates for a cultural return to faith, a rejection of the WEF manifested, globalist ideology.</p>
