I think they are not successful, but they try.” —Bernard Arnault</p><p>[30:43] “In business, I think the most important thing is to position yourself for long-term and not be too impatient, which I am by nature, and I have to control myself.” —Bernard Arnault</p><p>[33:35] He had such an appetite for victory and such a capacity for work that he was bound to succeed.</p><p>[35:26] “People think of politicians having true power, but that’s less and less true. After all, they are often constrained or being edged into a corner by a whole series of contingencies ... I’m lucky in that I can say, ‘I want my group to be in such and such a situation in 10 or 20 years’ time’ and then formulate a plan to make that happen.” –Bernard Arnault</p><p>[42:37] Those on the margins often come to control the center.</p><p>[43:10] Invest Like the Best episode <a href="https://pod.link/1154105909/episode/eef72e6684c5c8d40e5bbc163dc33303">Doug Leone —Lessons From A Titan</a></p><p>[48:31] Difference for the sake of it.
