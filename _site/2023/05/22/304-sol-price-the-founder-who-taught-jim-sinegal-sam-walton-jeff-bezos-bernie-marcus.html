The story of the father is embedded in the son. —<a href="https://amzn.to/3rI5bbz" target="_blank"><strong>Francis Ford Coppola: A Filmmaker's Life</strong></a> by Michael Schumacher. (Founders #242)</p><p>[14:00] Stephen King on the belief and support he received from his wife: “Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference”— <a href="https://amzn.to/3AvfXUe" target="_blank"><strong>Stephen King On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</strong></a>by Stephen King.

Because payroll and benefits represent 80% of a retailer’s cost of operations, pricing advantage follows labor productivity. Fewer items result in reduced labor hours throughout all of the product supply channels. Put simply, the cost to deal with 4,500 items is a lot less than the cost to deal with 50,000 items.</p><p>[50:21] The operating efficiencies of the warehouse concept and the direct delivery of products from the suppliers to Price Club made it possible to sell merchandise for less.</p><p>[55:00] Costco and Sam's were expanding aggressively while Price Club remained tentative.</p><p>[1:03:30] Sol was a poster child for the American dream. His immigrant parents were born in a small Russian village. Sol was the first in his family to graduate college. He earned a law degree. He became an exceptionally successful businessman and philanthropist, celebrated 70 years of marriage, was a good father who instilled high values in his sons, and he never walked away from responsibility.
