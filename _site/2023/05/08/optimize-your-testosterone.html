<p>When men think about optimizing their hormones, they tend only to think about raising their testosterone. But while increasing T can be important, an ideal health profile also means having testosterone that's in balance with your other hormones as well.</p><p>Today on the show, Dr. Kyle Gillett joins me to discuss both of those prongs of all-around hormone optimization. We start with a quick overview of the different hormones that affect male health. We then get into what qualifies as low testosterone and how to accurately test yours. We also discuss what causes low testosterone in individual men, and how its decline in the general male population may be linked to both birth control and the world wars. In the second half of our conversation, we discuss how to both raise testosterone and get rid of excess estrogen, including the use of some effective supplements you may never have heard of. We then get into the risks and benefits of taking TRT, before ending our discussion with what young men can do to prepare for a lifetime of optimal T and hormonal health.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/testosterone-week-intro/">AoM series on testosterone</a>, including <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/">How I Doubled My Testosterone Levels Naturally</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-testosterone-makes-men-men/">AoM Podcast #761: How Testosterone Makes Men, Men</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-877-the-fitness-supplements-that-actually-work/">AoM Podcast #878: The Fitness Supplements That Actually WorkÂ </a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Dr. Kyle Gillett</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kylegillettmd/">Kyle on IG</a></li><li>Gillett Health Podcast on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2GQGEPJqx44N7CD3JMZQrF?si=be83e8d475fd481d">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1631735999?ign-itscg=30200&ign-itsct=lt_p">Apple</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOa2JwlDOkLvDZDF1LjTa8A/videos">Gillett Health on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://gilletthealth.com/">Gillett Health website</a></li></ul>
