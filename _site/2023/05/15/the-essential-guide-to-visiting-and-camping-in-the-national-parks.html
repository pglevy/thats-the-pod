<p>America’s national parks are one of the country’s greatest treasures, and many people have it on their bucket list to visit one or more of these gems. But figuring out where to go and how to execute a national park experience can sometimes feel a little overwhelming.</p><p>Here to offer some really helpful advice on both visiting and camping in the national parks is Jeremy Puglisi, co-author, along with his wife Stephanie, of <a href="https://amzn.to/41B7xbp"><i>Where Should We Camp Next?: National Parks: The Best Campgrounds and Unique Outdoor Accommodations In and Around National Parks, Seashores, Monuments, and More</i></a>. Today on the show, Jeremy walks us through how to navigate the complex reservation system some of the parks have in place and what it takes to secure a campsite inside the parks. He then shares his best tips for getting the most out of a national park experience in general, as well as when you’re visiting some of the country’s most iconic destinations, including Yosemite, Yellowstone, and the Grand Canyon. At the end of our conversation, Jeremy shares the national parks he thinks are underrated, and if you want to avoid the crowds of the national parks, he also shares his picks for the country’s best state parks.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Jeremy’s previous appearance on the AoM podcast: <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/how-to-plan-a-road-trip/">Episode #711: — How to Plan the Ultimate Road Trip</a></li><li><a href="http://recreation.gov/">recreation.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://nps.gov/">nps.gov</a></li><li><a href="https://koa.com/">KOA campgrounds</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/beat-the-crowds-and-the-fees-with-dispersed-camping/">AoM Article: Beat the Crowds (And the Fees) With Dispersed Camping</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Jeremy Puglisi</h2><ul><li><a href="https://thervatlas.com/">The RV Atlas website</a></li><li><a href="https://thervatlas.com/podcast-landing/">The RV Atlas podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thervatlas/">RV Atlas on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/rvfta">RV Atlas on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/05/where-should-we-camp-next-national-parks-1.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
