<p>When Daniel Zia Joseph decided to join the Army at the unusually late age of 32, he solicited advice from his buddies who had served in the military on how to succeed in the experience and become a good officer and leader. Today, he passes on these leadership lessons to us.</p><p>Dan is the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3nlnGnj"><i>Backpack to Rucksack: Insight Into Leadership and Resilience From Military Experts</i></a>, and he first shares why he decided to join the Army at an older age and what he would tell other guys who keep thinking about doing the same thing. We talk about how he prepared himself to be a leader and how getting his masters in organizational psychology helped deepen his development. We then discuss the lessons his military mentors imparted to him, including why you should pursue attrition, the importance of command climate, using psychological jiu-jitsu, and the difference between garrison and field leadership.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9xPbezWmjw">Dan's video about joining the military after age 30</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/social-skills/authority-is-more-important-than-social-skills-in-being-influential/">AoM Podcast #875: Authority Is More Important Than Social Skills</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/are-you-a-strategist-or-an-operator/">AoM Article: Are You a Strategist or an Operator?</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3NyUPGS"><i>Once an Eagle</i> by Anton Myrer</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Dan Joseph</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9xPbezWmjw" target="_blank">Dan's website â€” Combat Psych</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/05/71HWOZo9MdL._AC_UF10001000_QL80_.jpg" alt="" />
