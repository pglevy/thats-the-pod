<p>Have you been languishing in the same role at work, frustrated that you haven't been promoted to a higher position with more pay and different responsibilities?</p><p>My guest can help you level up in your career. His name is Randy Ornstein, and he's the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3OMZUvF"><i>Grow: The Essential Guide to Getting Promoted</i></a>. Today on the show, Randy explains why getting promoted is more beneficial to your paycheck than getting a raise and his case for why you should stick with working for the same company for a long time. We then talk about the things you need to do so that management thinks of you the next time a higher position opens up. We discuss how promotable employees participate in meetings, execute their communication, study their work, and develop best practices. We also talk about when to bring up the idea of being promoted to your boss and a couple of the challenges that can come with advancing up the ranks.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/how-to-become-the-go-to-guy-at-work/">AoM Article: How To Become the Go-to Guy at Work</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/how-to-handle-a-promotion/">AoM Article: How to Be Manager to Your Friends and Peers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-273-get-job-promotion-year/">AoM Podcast #273: How to Get a Job Promotion This Year</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Randy Ornstein</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-ornstein-b23b923" target="_blank">Randy on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/05/88564058.jpg" alt="" />
