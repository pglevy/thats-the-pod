<p>Do you have a goal to lose weight? If so, you're probably thinking about how you need to exercise more. And that can certainly help. But what about the 23 hours a day you're not at the gym? How much you move during those hours — from walking to the mailbox to fidgeting at your desk — can be just as important in winning the battle of the bulge.</p><p>Here to explain the importance of what's called non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT, is Dr. James Levine, a professor, the co-director of the Mayo Clinic's Obesity Solutions Initiative, the inventor of the treadmill desk, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3vpBLnu"><i>Get Up!: Why Your Chair Is Killing You and What You Can Do About It</i></a>. James explains how much more sedentary we are than we used to be and what happens to your body when, as the average American does, you spend two-thirds of your day sitting. He shares how doing the lightest kinds of physical activity, even standing more, can help you lose a significant amount of weight and improve other aspects of health, from your sleep to your mood. And we talk about how to easily incorporate more NEAT into your day.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9880251/" target="_blank">Role of Nonexercise Activity Thermogenesis in Resistance to Fat Gain in Humans — James' overfeeding study</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/the-digestive-power-of-an-after-dinner-walk/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Digestive Power of an After-Dinner Walk</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-optimize-your-metabolism/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #552: How to Optimize Your Metabolism</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/the-importance-of-building-your-daily-sleep-pressure/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Importance of Building Your Daily Sleep Pressure</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/01/71cT93LzPNL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
