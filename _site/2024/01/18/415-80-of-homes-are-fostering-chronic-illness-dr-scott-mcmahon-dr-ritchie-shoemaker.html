<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with Dr. Scott McMahon and Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. They discuss their potentially groundbreaking research into CIRS, or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Backed by research, these two doctors believe that many other illnesses and syndromes such as fibromyalgia, obesity, and even depression might actually be caused by mutations in common mold as a response to our own efforts to live in a hypoallergenic world.</p><p> </p><p>Scott W. McMahon, MD, founder of Whole World Healthcare has been practicing pediatrics in Roswell, New Mexico, for 26 years. His interest in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) began in 2009. Dr. McMahon first learned about CIRS after being approached by a businessman whose daughter became ill while attending a local school. The search for this child’s healing led him to Dr. Richie Shoemaker, the global expert on mold illnesses. McMahon visited Dr. Shoemaker’s practice to learn about the treatment for CIRS and saw the tremendous need for more physicians prepared to treat CIRS. He immediately opened a practice in Roswell specifically to diagnose and treat patients with CIRS, starting with 15 patients from the local school. His CIRS practice has now grown and he has seen thousands of adults and children to date.</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. McMahon and Dr. Shoemaker:</p><p> </p><p>Surviving Mold (website) https://www.survivingmold.com/legal-resources/physician-referral-information/dr-scott-w-mcmahon-bio</p><p> </p><p>CIRC Diagnoses https://scottmcmahon.doctor/</p><p> </p><p>Boot Camp: A Beginners Guide to Spiritual Warfare</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/Boot-Camp-Beginners-Spiritual-Warfare-ebook/dp/B09QBKMP9Y/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1703614821&refinements=p_27%3ADr.+Scott+W.+McMahon&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Dr.+Scott+W.+McMahon</p><p> </p><p>The Art and Science of CIRS Medicine https://www.survivingmold.com/store/books/art-and-science-of-cirs</p>
