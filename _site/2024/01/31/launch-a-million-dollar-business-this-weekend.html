<p>Have you always wanted to be an entrepreneur but don’t have an idea for a business? Or have you been sitting on a business idea for years but have never gotten going with it?</p><p>Well, after listening to this podcast and by the end of this weekend, you can have a business started that could ultimately make you a million bucks.</p><p>Here to walk you through the process of becoming a near-overnight entrepreneur is Noah Kagan. Kagan is the founder of AppSumo, a software deals site, and half a dozen other multi-million-dollar businesses, as well as the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/49cH5sF"><i>Million Dollar Weekend: The Surprisingly Simple Way to Launch a 7-Figure Business in 48 Hours</i></a>. Today on the show, Noah and I first discuss the two biggest obstacles that hold people back from starting a business and how to overcome them. We then turn to the practicalities of coming up with and vetting a business idea, how to find your first customers, and how to keep growing from there. Along the way, Noah and I share insights into how we turned AppSumo and Art of Manliness, respectively, from side hustles into rewarding careers.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-315-noah-kagan-interview/" target="_blank">Noah’s previous appearance on the AoM Podcast: Episode #315 — The Power of Small Experiments to Supercharge Your Success</a></li><li>AoM Article: The Company Man’s Guide to Starting a Side Hustle, <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-i-confronting-your-objections/" target="_blank">Part I</a> and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/the-company-mans-guide-to-starting-a-side-hustle-part-ii-think-big-act-small/" target="_blank">Part II </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-start-a-business-consider-these-5-invaluable-lessons-before-diving-in/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Want to Start a Business?
