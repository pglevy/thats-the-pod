<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with ex-KGB spy, author, and podcaster, Jack Barsky. They discuss Jack’s upbringing under the communist utopian dream, following the motivating sentiment of “freedom for the oppressed,” how he embedded himself in American society, what brought him into contact with the FBI, and how he was able to walk away.</p><p>Jack Barsky (born Albrecht Dittrich, Jack being at first an American alias) is a German-American author, IT specialist and former sleeper agent of the KGB. He spied on the United States from 1978 to 1988, and was exposed after the Cold War. Barsky then became a resource for U.S. counterintelligence agencies, which secured his citizenship. His autobiography, “Deep Undercover,” was published in 2017.</p><p>This episode was recorded December 9th, 2023</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Jack Barsky: </p><p>Psychology Podcast website https://www.kgbspychology.com/</p><p>Deep Undercover: My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in America (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Undercover-Tangled-Allegiances-America/dp/1496416821 Jack’s personal website https://jackbarsky.com/</p><p>On Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackbarsky/</p><p>On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/jackbarskyofficial/</p><p>On Facebook https://www.facebook.com/spybarsky</p>
