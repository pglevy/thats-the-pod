[If Napoleon was alive you know he’d listen to Founders podcast](20:00) The Tao of Charlie Munger by Charlie Munger and David Clark (Founders #295)(20:00) Advance orders tend to stifle initiative. A commander should be left free to adapt himself to circumstances as they occur.(23:00) The art of war consists in a well organized and conservative defense, coupled with an audacious and rapid offensive.(26:00) Ten people who yell make more noise than ten thousand who keep silent.(29:00) Long orders, which require much time to prepare, to read and to understand are the enemies of speed. Napoleon could issue orders of few sentences which clearly expressed his intentions and required little time to issue and to understand.(31:00) A great leader will resort to audacity.(32:00) “Alexander the Great thought, decided, and above all, moved swiftly. He appreciated the importance of speed and the terrifying surprises speed made possible. His enemies were always stunned and shocked by his arrival. He invented the blitzkrieg.”  — Heroes: From Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar to Churchill and de Gaulle by Paul Johnson. (Episode #226)(34:00) It is no harm to be too strong; it may be fatal to be too weak.(41:00) Napoleon on single threaded leadership: Once a campaign has been decided upon there should be no hesitation in appointing one commander to assure its success. When authority is divided, opinions and actions differ, and confusion and delay arises. A single chief proceeds with vigor; he is not delayed by necessity to confer.(42:00) Posess obstinate will.(43:00) Experience must be supplemented by study. No man's personal experience can be so inclusive as to warrant his disregarding the experiences of others. (This is a great reason why you should invest in a subscription to Founders Notes ) (44:00) It is profitable to study the campaigns of the great masters.(47:00) Skill consists in converging a mass of fire upon a single point. He that has the skill to bring a sudden, unexpected concentration of artillery to bear upon a selected point is sure to capture it. (A lesson from Peter Thiel: Don’t divide your attention: focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort.)(49:00) All great captains have been diligent students [of history].----Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes----“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
