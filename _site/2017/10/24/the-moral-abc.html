<p>Dr. Bronner&apos;s Magic Soaps, which bills itself as the top-selling natural soapmaker in North America, wasn&apos;t founded to sell soap. The company was started to promote a religious philosophy developed by Emanuel Bronner, a third-generation German Jewish soapmaker, who printed his message on the labels of his potent peppermint liquid soap. Successive generations of the Bronner family have used the label&apos;s message of a united humanity to guide the company, which spends much of its profits on charitable causes and is outspoken on issues like wage equality and fair trade. Today, even as the idea of a united humanity seems more distant than ever, Dr. Bronner&apos;s continues to spread its soap and message worldwide.</p>
