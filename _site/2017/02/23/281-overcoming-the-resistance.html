<p>In today’s episode I'm welcoming back one of my all-time favorite guests, writer Steven Pressfield. Steven is the author of several popular novels including &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance,&quot; &quot;Gates of Fire,&quot; and &quot;The Virtues of War.&quot; He’s also written several popular non-fiction books on the creative process, like &quot;Do the Work&quot; and &quot;The War of Art,&quot; which cover how to overcome what he calls &quot;the Resistance.&quot; Steve’s now got a new novel out called &quot;The Knowledge.&quot; It’s based on his early days as a writer in 1970s New York City and provides the backstory of how he learned to overcome the Resistance in his own life.<br />Today on the show, Steve and I discuss how the Resistance rears its ugly head in our lives and how to overcome it by transforming from an amateur to a professional. We then talk about Steve’s early days as a writer and the struggles he went through in becoming a pro.<br />If you are or someday hope to be a writer, artist, or entrepreneur, you’re going to love this episode. It’s filled with insights on the mindset you need to adopt in order to thrive in any endeavor.</p>
