<p>Being tired isn&apos;t a badge of honor. There, we said it. We&apos;ve been saying this for a while now, because our culture loves to glorify toiling long hours for its own sake and we think that leads to subpar work and general misery. In this episode, we talk to a veteran of the video game industry and a member of Basecamp&apos;s customer support team about workaholism and burnout. We also hear from a new business owner who&apos;s balancing mindfulness with the demands of starting her own meditation-focused company.</p>
