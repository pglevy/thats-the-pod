<p>Do you sometimes wish you had a cabinet of counselors you could go to for advice and insight on how to make life better and easier for yourself? <br />Well, my guest today created his own board of mighty mentors — a metaphorical round table of some of the most successful people in the world — and asked them all the same 11 questions on how to live a more fulfilling and productive life. And he wrote a book to share all the insights he learned with others.  <br />His name is Tim Ferriss, and he's an author and the host of the Tim Ferriss Podcast. In his latest book, &quot;Tribe of Mentors: Short Life Advice From the Best in the World,&quot; Tim shares the answers he got to the 11 questions he posed to a diverse range of successful people like Steven Pressfield, Jocko Willink, Bear Grylls, and Greg Norman, among many others. In today’s episode, Tim shares insights from the people he interviewed on how to say no without feeling guilty or looking like a jerk, the books successful people frequently gift others, and what to do when you’re feeling overwhelmed, distracted, and just generally down.</p>
