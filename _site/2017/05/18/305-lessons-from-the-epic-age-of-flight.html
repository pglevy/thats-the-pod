<p>My guest on today's show is Winston Groom, author of &quot;The Aviators: Eddie Rickenbacker, Jimmy Doolittle, Charles Lindbergh, and the Epic Age of Flight.&quot;<br />Winston Groom has authored numerous history and historical fiction books, including &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; as well as the subject of today's show, &quot;The Aviators,&quot; in which he details the engaging history of these pioneers of flight and their service to their country. Today on the show, we discuss each of these men and their respective heroics -- from Lindbergh’s famous flight across the Atlantic, to Doolittle’s legendary raid on Tokyo, to Rickenbacker’s survival at sea for 23 days. We also dig into their complex characters and specifically, Lindbergh’s testy relationship with the press and how his initial opposition to the U.S. entering WWII got him labeled a traitor by FDR.<br />Winston is a masterful storyteller so you’re in for a real treat today. You’re going to be left both entertained and inspired by these three men.</p>
