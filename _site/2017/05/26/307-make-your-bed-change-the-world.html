<p>My guest today is retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, author of &quot;Make Your Bed.&quot;<br />Today on the show, Admiral McRaven and I discuss why something as simple as making your bed every day can lay the foundation for success in every aspect of your life, how a parachuting accident taught him an important lesson on avoiding self-pity and learning to rely on the help of others, and why rolling in the sand as a SEAL trainee taught him how to become more resilient to the whims of life. We end our conversation by talking about how a leader can remain hopeful and share that hope with his team when all seems hopeless, and what you have to do to avoid &quot;ringing the bell.&quot;<br />This podcast will leave you fired up to make your bed, and become a better man.</p>
