<p>My guest today is David Kwong. He’s a magician, New York Times crossword creator, and now author of the book &quot;Spellbound: Seven Principles of Illusion to Captivate Audiences and Unlock the Secrets of Success.<br />Today on the show, David and I discuss how several key principles from magic can be applied beyond the stage and make you more successful in business and life. We’ll learn what it means to “load up” in magic and how Richard Branson used that principle to start Virgin Airlines, and why storytelling is key for executing both a successful magic trick and a successful business. We also discuss how magicians plan for tricks gone awry and the lessons non-magicians can take from that preparation. We even get into the mutual admiration Theodore Roosevelt and Houdini had for each other and how Houdini personified Roosevelt's ideal of living &quot;the strenuous life.&quot;</p>
