<p>Today's guest is Kyle Eschenroeder, author of &quot;The Pocket Guide to Action.&quot;<br />Last year, Kyle published a piece on the site called &quot;Meditations on the Wisdom of Action.&quot; It contained 116 short, punchy devotional-esque passages on the nature and importance of action. It was my favorite piece of content in 2016, and I still find myself continually thinking about its principles, and utilizing them in my life. The feedback we’ve received from readers has been similarly enthusiastic. At over 16,000 words, this longform article was about the length of a short book. So we decided to turn it into one, and titled it &quot;The Pocket Guide to Action: 116 Meditations on the Art of Doing.&quot;<br />Today on the show, I’ve brought Kyle on to dig deep into his philosophy on action. He shares why inaction can be expensive, how action can sometimes mean not doing anything, and why taking action is the best way to find courage and passion in life. Along the way, he shares tactics you can take today to help shift yourself into a more action-oriented mindset.<br />If you’ve been struggling to get started on a project or have just been feeling unmotivated, this podcast will light a fire under your rear!</p>
