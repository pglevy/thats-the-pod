<p>Do you find yourself making the same mistakes over and over again in your relationships?<br />For example, do you have a tendency to ignore red flags and constantly end up in relationships that aren’t healthy for you?<br />Maybe you end up in relationships where the initial chemistry is good, but a few months later, you’re looking for any way out.<br />Well, if any of those descriptions describe you (or a friend who needs some advice!), then give this podcast a listen.<br />My guests today argue that your problem is that you let yourself get suckered by love. Their names are Michael and Sarah Bennett. Michael is a psychiatrist. Sarah is Michael’s daughter and a comedy writer. I had them on the show previously to talk about their book &quot;F<em>ck Feelings.&quot; In their latest book, &quot;F</em>ck Love,&quot; they focus on the most messed up feeling of all: love.<br />Despite the irreverent title of their book, the Bennetts provide surprisingly solid and old-fashioned advice when it comes to establishing long-lasting and fulfilling relationships. They discuss why our emotions can lead us astray in relationships and why men are actually more prone to being bamboozled by romantic feelings than women. They then share both the red flags and the positive qualities you should be on the lookout for in a partner if you want a happy relationship. They also discuss what you should do in a relationship in which you're not happy and why couple's therapy is often not very useful.<br />This is a podcast full of laughs, as well as some seriously helpful insights on how to navigate relationships effectively.<br />Note: Even though the title of the book contains &quot;F*ck,&quot; there's no swearing in this episode.</p>
