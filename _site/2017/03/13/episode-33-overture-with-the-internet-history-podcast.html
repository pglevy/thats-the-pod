<p>Episode 33: Overture (with the Internet History Podcast!)    Ben &amp; David dive deep into the early days of internet search, with the help of the best in the internet history business: <a href="https://twitter.com/brianmcc">Brian McCullough</a> from the <a href="http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/">Internet History Podcast</a>! We are huge fans of IHP at Acquired, so this was a real treat to collaborate with Brian and the great work he does over there. In this episode we cover the story of how a small incubator in Southern California spawned perhaps the greatest tech business model of all-time, Yahoo!’s fumbling of that golden opportunity, and Google’s recovery of that fumble to cross into the end zone of tech history behind the biggest moat ever constructed on the internet.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br>Topics covered include: <ul><li>Overture’s origins as part of the <a href="https://www.idealab.com/">Idealab</a> incubator run by famed early internet entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gross_(entrepreneur)">Bill Gross</a></li><li>Invention of the paid search business model… initially by returning ADS ONLY in response to search queries</li><li>The eventual marrying of Overture’s paid search (ads) with organic search results via syndication on other properties like Yahoo!</li><li>Revenue from Overture’s ad partnership saving Yahoo!’s business after the internet bubble burst </li><li>Yahoo!’s eventual acquisition of Overture for $1.4B in 2003 </li><li>But… the really interesting story here: Overture’s 'inspiration' of Google’s business model and the creation of "the greatest advertising machine in the history of the world"</li><li>The original (pre-Overture) Google business model: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search_Appliance">selling a box</a>! </li><li>Google’s differentiation vs Overture: focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">the long tail</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Score">ad quality scores</a>, and an advertiser-friendly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-googles-ad-auctions-work-1484827203">auction structure</a></li><li>Google’s first major search syndication victory over Overture: <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2047741/overture-inktomi-out-google-in-at-aol">AOL</a></li><li>Yahoo!’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/02/yahoo-3/">failed attempt to buy Google for $3B in 2002</a>, leading it to settle for acquiring Overture instead the following year</li><li>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_(ad_system)">Project Panama</a>” at Yahoo!, and <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/11/27/the-fall-and-rise-of-yahoo-tech/">its impact on the tech and internet history</a></li><li>Overture's (and later Yahoo!’s) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/business/technology-google-and-yahoo-settle-dispute-over-search-patent.html?_r=0">lawsuit against Google</a> for stealing the paid search business model— "the O.G. version of Snapchat and Instagram”</li><li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html">Paul Graham’s take on "What Happened to Yahoo?”</a></li><li>Perhaps the most important technology to come out of this whole episode: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/10/how-yahoo-spawned-hadoop/">Hadoop</a></li><li>The power of incentive alignment in marketplaces— and creating the widest and deepest moats on the internet</li></ul><p>  The Carve Out: </p><ul><li>Ben: The famous University of Washington's “Love Lab” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gottman">Dr. John Gottman</a>: “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/">The Secret to Love is Just Kindness</a>”</li><li>David: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a></li><li>Brian: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Valley-Panorama-1930s-ebook/dp/B000XUBD8U/">The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s</a></li></ul>
