<p>My guest today is Paul Bogard, author of &quot;The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light.&quot;<br />Today on the show, Paul and I discuss what true darkness actually looks like and the type of un-dark night most modern folks experience. He then shares the last few spots in America and Europe where you can still experience true darkness and what the sky in those places looks like. We then delve into what we miss out on spiritually by not experiencing true darkness and the health detriments that come with being exposed to artificial light 24 hours a day. Paul also shares some of the common myths about darkness, such as the idea that darkness is more dangerous than light.<br />This show is going to inspire you to seek out a remote area of wilderness so you can experience the beauty that comes with a truly dark night.</p>
