Sam (@theSamParr) is joined by Andrew (@awilkinson) to catch up. They spend the first half of the episode talking about the investments they've each made in 2021. Andrew then dives into a more obscure investment he made: a bakery! He explains it's more for fun than profit. Andrew also drops some great hacks: how he saves time on email and how he networks with billionaires.
