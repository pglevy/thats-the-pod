<p>I had the pleasure of speaking with Senator Mike Lee on February 18, 2021. We discuss his experiences as a United States Senator for the state of Utah. Senator Lee and I talked at length about the structure and original formation of the US government. We also cover his hypothesis of what’s happening politically today, why it’s a problem, as well as possible solutions.</p><p>Mike Lee has been a conservative Republican for the state of Utah since January 3, 2011. He is also a New York Times bestseller with his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Written-Out-History-Forgotten-Government/dp/0399564454">“Written Out of History: The Forgotten Founders Who Fought Big Government.” </a></p><p>Find more of Senator Mike Lee on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@SenMikeLee</a> and in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mike-Lee/e/B005D1X13Y/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1">books</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p>For advertising inquiries, please email sales@advertisecast.com</p><p> </p>
