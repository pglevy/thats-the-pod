We start this one off with a little "Inside MFM" from Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) as they discuss growing the pod and how they are going to do it. Then they break down the big news of the week: the Coinbase IPO. They talk about Coinbase's humble origins on HackerNews and how most big businesses have these same origins. It's often hard to see the big picture in the early days. They also talk about their own early days and give advice to young entrepreneurs. The second half of the pod turns into a brainstorm. They brainstorm around indie businesses like Microacquire and Photopea and how to build similar businesses. Finally, we end it by discussing the opportunities around "Affirm for X".
