<p>This episode was recorded on January 15, 2021.</p><p>Douglas Murray and I discuss, among other topics, the collapse of grand narratives on the left and the right alike, the potential for the resultant explanatory and motivational void to be filled by more radical ideological ideas, and the dangers posed by the mutual recrimination that all-too-frequently characterizes relationships across the left-right divide.</p><p>Douglas Murray is a British best-selling author (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madness-Crowds-Gender-Race-Identity/dp/1635579988">The Madness of Crowds</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Death-Europe-Immigration-Identity/dp/1472942248/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="> The Strange Death of Europe</a>) and a columnist and associate editor at The Spectator (UK).
