<p>Yeonmi Park's account of her experience at Columbia University is harrowing - as someone who had just arrived in the West after her escape from North Korea, the idea that she had to censor herself at a prestigious university like Columbia, or any university for that matter - which have historically been bastions of free thought is horrifying. Her experience serves as one example of just how far the Universities have deteriorated.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Dr Peterson wanted to put this together because he still feels like it’s possible to save the Universities, but before that can happen, more people need to be aware of just how twisted they’ve become. Feel free to share and reference this video as some evidence and perspectives on the state of Western Universities.</p><p> </p>
