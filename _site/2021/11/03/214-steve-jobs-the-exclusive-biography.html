<p>What I learned from rereading <a href="https://amzn.to/3mHZRmB">Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography</a> by Walter Isaacson. </p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>1. He had the attitude that he could do anything, and therefore so can you.<br /><br />2. He refused to accept automatically received truths, and he wanted to examine everything himself.<br /><br />3. Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.<br /><br />4. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.<br /><br />5. The way we're running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this: Let's make it simple. Really simple.<br /><br />6. Jobs’s intensity was also evident in his ability to focus. He would set priorities, aim his laser attention on them, and filter out distractions.<br /><br />7. The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.<br /><br />8. One of Jobs's talents was spotting markets that were filled with second-rate products.<br /><br />9. Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.<br /><br />10. His mind was never a captive of reality. He possessed an epic sense of possibility. He looked at things from the standpoint of perfection.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
