There is nobody with a master key" - Saifedean Ammous</p><p>[10:36] How the Bitcoin network functions using "consensus parameters"</p><p>[15:49] "The way that Bitcoin came about seems... virtually impossible to believe" - Jordan Peterson</p><p>[18:27] Other schools of economics (Austrian) vs. the most common today (Keynesian)</p><p>[20:46] "So the Austrian school of economics... tilts you more towards an appreciation of non-centrally controlled, distributed networks, and emphasis on the individual actor" - JP</p><p>[23:25] Paul Samuelson and communist economic expectations of centralized planning post-WW2</p><p>[25:27] Dr. Ammous' academic background</p><p>[27:14] Climate change. The push towards central planning, implying certain people or groups know the exact consequences and solutions to future economic developments</p><p>[29:41] "I've been struck by the problem of unintended consequences and the irreducible complexity of things. We can talk about the problem of climate change, but those words are incredibly deceiving" - JP</p><p>[34:16] Highlighting the crucial role of the entrepreneur in Austrian economics</p><p>[40:46] Saifedean reflects on the views held by the central bank, governments, and mainstream economists on money—as opposed to Bitcoin's structuring and the Austrian school of thought</p><p>[41:43] "From the Austrian perspective, money is a product of the market and not the invention of the state.

The devastating effect of hyperinflation on the average person</p><p>[58:15] "Money is an incredible technology for lowering our time preference" - SA</p><p>[58:59] "The 20th century was a global trainwreck of watching the money preference rise. Generation after generation... witnessed their money devalue" - SA</p><p>[01:02:32] Why some efforts in energy production are misguided</p><p>[01:06:39] The Fiat Standard</p><p>[01:10:29] Why are we allowing people to mine bitcoin?</p><p>[01:12:46] The genius that went into the production of the Bitcoin code</p><p>[01:23:14] The crazy reality of decision-making at climate change panels</p><p>[01:26:36] Fiat-based currency jobs and the Zoom warriors disconnected from the physical world</p><p>[01:31:09] "A lot of the problems of the 20th century, in my opinion, have their roots in highly inflationary fiat currency" - SA</p><p>[01:31:18] Covering some of the common objections against Bitcoin</p><p>[01:39:45] "We are always going to find more reasons to print money" - SA</p><p>[01:41:43] Ammous’ online learning platform</p><p>[01:48:29] The growth of Saifedeen.com and the parameters attributed to its success</p><p>[01:50:05] The possibility of decentralizing societal accreditation</p><p>[01:50:21] "I've talked to seriously wise academics who know that there is almost zero financial knowledge in universities [today]... There is tremendous residual value, however, in the accreditation" - JP</p><p>[01:56:18] Wrapping up</p><p><br /></p><p>#Crypto #FiatStandard #Bitcoin #JordanPeterson #Decentralization</p><p> </p>
