<p>This episode was recorded on October 18th, 2021.</p><p><br /></p><p>Mustafa Akyol joins me to discuss Muslim history and tradition.

Norton, his 2011 book, "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty," presents a strong argument for Islamic liberalism. The book was long-listed for the Lionel Gelber Prize for best nonfiction book. It was also praised by The Financial Times as "a forthright and elegant Muslim defense of freedom." His other books include "Reopening Muslim Minds" and "The Islamic Jesus."</p><p><br /></p><p>Find Mustafa's most important book, "Reopening Muslim Minds," here</p><p>https://amazon.com/Reopening-Muslim-Minds-Freedom-Tolerance</p><p><br /></p><p>His book "The Islamic Jesus," discussed in this episode, is at</p><p>https://amazon.com/Islamic-Jesus-Became-Prophet-Muslims</p><p><br /></p><p>Find a free PDF of his book "Why, As a Muslim, I Defend Liberty" at</p><p>https://libertarianism.org/books/why-muslim-i-defend-liberty</p><p><br /></p><p>Or visit his page at the Cato Institute:</p><p>https://cato.org/people/mustafa-akyol</p><p>_____</p><p>[00:00] Introduction</p><p>[02:47] Regarding the separation of church and state, what do Christians and Muslims have in common?</p><p>[10:36] What are some similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?</p><p>[11:05] "I see the world's history, and I see a Judeo-Christian/Islamic history because it's all Abrahamic monotheism starting at Judaism." Mustafa Akyol</p><p>[11:46] What the Three Abrahamic religions have in common—monotheism, rooting in the same tradition; and strange insistence on a book as the bedrock of culture</p><p>[12:45] Unique ideas of religious and societal tolerance through different ages in history</p><p>[21:10] The connection Jesus and Islam</p><p>[28:45] What is the totalitarian impulse?</p><p>[29:30] "I think it is an understatement of the severity of the totalitarian problem to attribute it merely to the religious." - Jordan Peterson</p><p>[31:27] Critiquing the inevitable flaws of the purely secular state.

Another group, that it only creates that difference through the imposition</p><p>[01:27:01] Mary's role in the Quran and Islamic tradition</p><p>[01:31:29] The influence of gnostic Christian gospels on Muhammad in Mustafa's opinion.
