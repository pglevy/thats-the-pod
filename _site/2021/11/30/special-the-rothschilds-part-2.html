This is a special release of the 2-part Rothschild series from the How to Take Over the World podcast with Ben Wilson.
Description - How did the Rothschilds go from a poor family inhabiting a part-share of a home in a Jewish ghetto to the richest family of all time in less than 50 years? Listen to how they reach their zenith, and what has happened to the family since then on How to Take Over the World.
