<p>I used to wake up early, around 5:15, and do my workout right after getting out of bed. But I noticed I was tired all day, and just felt kind of stiff and not very strong during my workouts. So I decided to try waking up a couple hours later, and doing my workouts in the late afternoon instead. I found that setting up my schedule this way gave me greater energy, both overall, and during my workouts.</p><p>My guest says that this tinkering I did with my routine is an example of life prototyping, a process that can be used for anything and everything in order to improve both your personal and professional life.</p><p>His name is Dave Evans, and as a lecturer in Stanford’s Design Program, he teaches the popular <a href="https://designingyour.life/">Designing Your Life course</a>, which, as the name implies, takes the principles of design thinking, and applies them to crafting a happy and fulfilling life. He’s also the co-author, along with Bill Burnett, of <a href="https://amzn.to/3pV2FNq"><i>Designing Your Life</i></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3DZIIKd"><i>Designing Your New Work Life</i></a>. Today on the show, Dave explains how one of the central steps to design thinking — prototyping — can help you make both big and small changes that move you closer to the life you want to lead. He explains what prototyping is, how prototyping a life is different from prototyping a product, the two approaches involved with the former, and embracing the design thinking mindset of being immune to failure.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.creativelive.com/class/designing-your-life-how-to-build-a-well-lived-joyful-life-bill-burnett-dave-evans">The Designing Your Life Course on Creative Live</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-418-how-to-get-unstuck/">AoM Podcast #418 on how to get unstuck in life with the co-founder of Stanford’s Design School, Bernie Roth</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/create-a-life-plan/">AoM series on crafting the life you want</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/futurists-guide-to-building-the-life-you-want/">AoM Podcast #731: A Futurist’s Guide to Building the Life You Want</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/how-to-deal-with-a-job-you-dont-like/">AoM Article: How to Deal With a Job You Don’t Like</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/ooda-loop/">AoM article on the OODA Loop</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Dave Evans</h2><ul><li><a href="https://designingyour.life/">Designing Your Life Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/12/81AE76v5odL.jpeg" alt="" width="350" />
