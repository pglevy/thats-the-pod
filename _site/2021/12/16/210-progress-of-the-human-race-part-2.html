<p>This is part two of our investigation into the Progress of the Human Race, and we would like to restate our goal here. All the mainstream media ever talk about is how the world’s in dire straits, how we’re going in an irreversible direction, and how it’s all our fault. We explored this narrative in depth in season 4 of the podcast. And we’d like to promote an alternative narrative–one where, in almost every direction you look, you find progress at a rate that, for most of history, would sound like sci-fi.</p><p><br /></p><p>This episode, part two, once again heavily features Marian Tupy, dad’s guest on episode 14 of the current podcast season. Marian is a senior fellow at Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity and co-authored the incredible book “Ten Global Trends Every Smart Person Should Know,” which I’m sure many of you will know.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also featured in this episode are Michael Shellenberger, Dr. Saifedean Ammous, Viscount Matt Ridley, Steven Pinker, and Bjorn Lomborg. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p> </p>
