<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3juvL3S">Michael Jordan: The Life</a> by Roland Lazenby.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[5:07] His competence was exceeded only by his confidence.<br /><br />[5:58] He worked at the game, and if he wasn't good at something, he had the motivation to be the best at it.</p><p>[6:33] It seemed that he discovered the secret quite early in his competitive life: the more pressure he heaped on himself, the greater his ability to rise to the occasion.</p><p>[14:06] At each step along his path, others would express amazement at how hard he competed.

When you miss that one day, you feel like you missed a lot. You take extra work to make up for that one day. <strong>I've always been a practice player. I believe in it</strong>.<br /><br />[1:29:47] Jordan presented a singleness of purpose that was hard to dent.<br />----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
