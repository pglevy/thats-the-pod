<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2RTDePh">Driven: An Autobiography</a> by Larry Miller. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>[1:01] I decided I had to be extremely good at something. </p><p>[2:47] I’m sorry to say, neglecting my family to do all of the above. I worked and worked and worked, day after day, night after night, dawn to bedtime. </p><p>[5:23] He owned movie theaters, auto dealerships, a motorsports park with a world-class racetrack, a movie production company, an advertising agency, ranches, restaurants, TV and radio stations, a real-estate development company, an NBA franchise, a professional baseball team, an NBA arena, sports apparel stores—nearly 90 companies in all, in six states, with 7,000 employees, all under the umbrella of The Larry H. Miller Group, which produces $3.2 billion in sales annually, ranking it among the 200 largest privately owned companies in the United States. </p><p>[7:23] The chain of events that began my entrepreneurial career was sparked by three failures: I dropped out of college, got laid off, and got demoted. </p><p>[35:22]<strong> It’s excellence for the sake of excellence. It just feels good being excellent, doing your best, learning everything you can about anything to which you apply yourself and then doing that thing well</strong>. </p><p>[38:40] <strong>The insanely long hours that I worked were driven by fear, but then the success became intoxicating</strong>. Clearly, my motivation to work like that shifted from fear-driven to success-driven. </p><p>[40:36]  A bunch of people say, “I wanna have . . .” and “I wanna be . . .” but <strong>they’re not willing to pay the price. The price is time and effort and being a student of what you’re doing</strong>.</p><p>[48:15] <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/fast">https://patrickcollison.com/fast</a>. </p><p>[56:15] Working all the time made me successful. It made me a failure, too. I missed most of my children’s youth. I missed ball games and science fairs and back-to-school nights. I missed the first day of kindergarten and playing catch in the yard. I missed dinner at home with my wife and kids. </p><p>[1:00:53] I try to pass these painful lessons to others who might be tempted by the allure of professional success. <strong>Mine is a cautionary tale</strong>. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
