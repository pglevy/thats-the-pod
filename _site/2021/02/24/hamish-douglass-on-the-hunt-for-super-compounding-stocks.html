<p>Our guest this week is Hamish Douglass. He is the co-founder, chairman, and chief investment officer of Magellan Financial Group, a roughly $80 billion asset-management firm with headquarters in Sydney. Among his duties, Douglass is lead manager of the Magellan Global Equity strategy, which is a concentrated portfolio of high-quality growth stocks. That strategy has been very successful since its July 2007 inception, handily beating its benchmark, the MSCI World Index, with significantly less risk. Before forming Magellan in 2006, Douglass was co-head of global banking for Deutsche Bank in Australia and New Zealand. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of New South Wales.</p><p><strong>Background</strong><br /><a href="https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Hamish-Macquarie-Douglass-7923/biography/" target="_blank">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fmgex/quote">Frontier MFG Global Equity</a></p><p>"<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116579746317346028" target="_blank">The Essential Balance: Independent Thinker, Team Player</a>," by Rebecca Thurlow, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Dec. 11, 2006.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.magellangroup.com.au/insights/learn-more-about-magellans-global-equity-strategy/" target="_blank">Learn More About Magellan's Global Equity Strategy</a>," Magellan, July 2019.</p><p>"<a href="https://mfgam.com.au/insights/being-a-successful-investor/" target="_blank">Being a Successful Investor</a>," by Hamish Douglass, MFG Asset Management.</p><p><strong>Investment Style and Portfolio Construction</strong><br />"<a href="https://de.mfgam.com.au/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&fileID=0FBBF57A-A127-4348-9C55476A27538A23">10 Cognitive Biases That Can Lead to Investment Mistakes</a>," by Hamish Douglass, Magellan, May 2017.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.firstlinks.com.au/business-model-disruption/" target="_blank">Business Model Disruption Has Barely Begun</a>," by Hamish Douglass, Firstlinks, Oct. 15, 2017.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.firstlinks.com.au/business-model-disruption-part-2" target="_blank">Business Model Disruption--Part 2</a>," by Hamish Douglass, Firstlinks, Oct. 19, 2017.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.magellangroup.com.au/insights/passive-investing-and-disruption/" target="_blank">Passive Investing and Disruption</a>," by Hamish Douglass, Magellan, July 2017.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.firstlinks.com.au/reflections-investor-hamish-douglass" target="_blank">13 of the best: reflections from an investor</a>,” by Hamish Douglass, <i>Firstlinks</i>, July 31, 2019.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/douglass-investing-blueprint-for-the-next-decade-20200123-p53u0k" target="_blank">Hamish Douglass' Map for Investing This Decade</a>," by Vesna Poljak, <i>Financial Review</i>, Jan. 24, 2020.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.firstlinks.com.au/hamish-douglass-on-what-really-matters" target="_blank">Hamish Douglass on What Really Matters</a>," by Hamish Douglass and Frank Casarotti, Firstlinks, Oct. 21, 2020.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/what-sort-of-economy-awaits-on-the-other-side-hamish-douglass-shares-four-possibilities" target="_blank">What Sort of Economy Awaits on the Other Side?
