<p>Rucking, that is, walking with a weighted backpack, started as something that soldiers did to carry the gear and equipment needed for combat. In recent times, rucking has become an increasingly popular form of exercise, and if you've wanted to try it, or have already started but would like to improve your practice, my guest today has some advice.</p>
<p>His name is <a href="https://joshstrength.com/">Josh Bryant</a> and he's a strength coach and the author of multiple books on fitness, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08S77WRXS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B08S77WRXS&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Rucking Gains</em></a>. Josh explains how rucking got its start in ancient armies, the kind of loads modern soldiers carry today, and why civilians should consider adopting this military-born modality. After unpacking the benefits of rucking, we get into how to walk with proper form, at the right pace, and choose what terrain to traverse. We discuss how to program your rucking workouts, how to make them progressively more challenging, and how to integrate them into your fitness routine without having it interfere with the strength gains you're developing in the gym. We end our conversation with exercises you can do with your rucksack besides humping it.</p>
