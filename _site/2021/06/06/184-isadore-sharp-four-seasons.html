<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3sxzIIL">Four Seasons: The Story of a Business Philosophy</a> by Isadore Sharp.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----<br /><br />[0:01] When I built my first hotel I knew nothing about the hotel business. </p><p>[4:28] He refused to settle for the pragmatic dictum of maturity. Issy also skipped skepticism and "Let's be sensible." People said he was naïve, with a kind of glandular optimism. Perhaps. But as it turned out naïveté served him well. <br /><br />[6:32] <strong>Early on he made some audacious statements that sounded like pipe dreams. He told me once that his aim was to make the name Four Seasons a worldwide brand, synonymous with luxury, like Rolls-Royce</strong>.<br /><br />[8:39]Once, when Dad was excavating a basement with horse and plough, <strong>he broke his shoulder. But he shrugged it off and uncomplainingly kept on working</strong>, something I never forgot. <br /><br />[26:52] I decided to go ahead. I foresaw only one difficulty, but it loomed large: <strong>How do you build a two-hundred-room resort without any money? This was literal fact</strong>. My earnings barely covered my rising family costs. <br /><br />[35:23] I asked Sir Gerald Glover, "How do you keep your lawn so perfect?"  “No problem”, he replied. “You just cut it every week for three hundred years.” </p><p>[43:48] I owe my success to my freedom. I think for me independence has an incalculable value. </p><p>[44:44] All business proceeds on belief: Trying to run a company without a set of beliefs is like trying to steer a ship without a rudder. </p><p>[56:03] The experience made me realize what I would really like to do: create a group of the best hotels in the world. And <strong>what we really want to do is usually what we do best</strong>.<br /><br />[56:51] We will not be all things to all people. We will specialize. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
