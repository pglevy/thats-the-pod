<p><em>Editor's Note: This is a rebroadcast. The episode originally aired in November 2017. </em></p>
<p>Have you ever just wanted to get in your car, drive off into the middle of nowhere, leave behind the hustle and bustle of civilization, and just be by yourself? </p>
<p>Well, in 1986 a man named Christopher Knight did just that and lived alone in the Maine woods without any, <em>any</em> human contact for 27 years until he was discovered in 2013.</p>
<p>My guest today wrote a biography — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GYPY884/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01GYPY884&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>The Stranger in the Woods</em></a> — about this man who locals called “the Hermit of the North Pond.” His name is <a href="https://www.michaelfinkel.com/">Michael Finkel</a> and today on the show we discuss how Chris survived alone in the Maine woods by himself, but more importantly, <em>why</em> Chris wanted to be by himself for so long. By looking at the life of one of the modern world's last true hermits, Michael and I explore the idea of hermitage, solitude, and why being an individual requires you to be alone. </p>
