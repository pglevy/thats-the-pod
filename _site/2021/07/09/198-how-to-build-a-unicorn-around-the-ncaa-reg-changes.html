Sam (@TheSamParr) and Shaan (@ShaanVP) break down opportunities created by the NCAA regulation changes. One of those ideas Sam said was the best he's heard in months. They also talk about Sam's road trip adventure to New York. The guys finish the episode brainstorming ideas ranging from an internal search engine for company documents to Zapier for sounds to referral programs.
