<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Leif Dahleen, who heads up the popular Physician on FIRE blog. Leif retired from his career as an anesthesiologist at age 43. Since that time, he has been blogging about his own financial independence, retire early journey, sharing early retirement and investing guidance with other professionals who might also wish to retire early. He attended the University of Minnesota for his undergraduate and medical school education, completed an internship at Gundersen Lutheran in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and finished his residency at the University of Florida.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/about-me/">Bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/">Physician on FIRE</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Early Retirement Lifestyle and Financial Considerations</strong></p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1010366/ramit-sethi-what-is-your-rich-life">Ramit Sethi: ‘What Is Your Rich Life?</a>’” <em>The Long View</em> Podcast, Morningstar.com, Nov. 10, 2020.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/78">Karsten Jeske: Cracking the Code on Retirement Spending Rates</a>,” <em>The Long View</em> Podcast, Morningstar.com, Oct. 14, 2020.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/986950/tanja-hester-the-pandemic-will-stoke-interest-in-early-retirement">Tanja Hester: The Pandemic Will Stoke Interest in Early Retirement</a>,” <em>The Long View</em> podcast, Morningstar.com, June 3, 2020. </p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/961948/chris-mamula-what-young-retirees-need-to-know">Chris Mamula: What Young Retirees Need to Know</a>,” <em>The Long View</em> podcast, Morningstar.com, Jan. 15, 2020. </p></p><p><p><a href="https://affordanything.com/" target="_blank">Afford Anything</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/" target="_blank">The White Coat Investor</a></p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/choose-fi/" target="_blank">Choose FI Over Fire</a>,” by Leif Dahleen, physicianonfire.com.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/retirement-withdrawal-plans/" target="_blank">The Most Important Factor in Retirement Withdrawal Plans</a>,” by Leif Dahleen, physicianonfire.com.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://thephysicianphilosopher.com/how-early-retirement-prepared-us-for-the-pandemic/" target="_blank">How Early Retirement Prepared Us for the Pandemic</a>,” by Leif Dahleen, thephysicianphilosopher.com. </p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/investing-in-a-bear-market/" target="_blank">How to Get Wealthy Investing in a Bear Market</a>,” by Leif Dahleen, physicianonfire.com.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/asset-location-in-retirement/" target="_blank">Asset Location and Making Your Money Last in Early Retirement</a>,” by Leif Dahleen, physicianonfire.com.</p></p><p><p>“<a href="https://www.physicianonfire.com/worried-about-inflation/" target="_blank">Prices Are Rising.
