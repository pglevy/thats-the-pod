<p><p>Over the next two weeks, we'll be taking a closer look at the state of retirement security in the United States, and we'll be featuring two very different perspectives on the topic. We're kicking things off with labor economist and retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, who will offer a progressive perspective. Ghilarducci joined The New School for Social Research as a professor of economics in 2008 after teaching at Notre Dame for 25 years. At The New School, she also directs the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, which focuses on economic policy research and outreach. Ghilarducci has frequently testified before U.S. Congress on matters of retirement planning. She has also published numerous research pieces in economics journals and has authored several books. Her most recent book, <em>Rescuing Retirement</em>, is co-authored by Tony James, executive vice chairman of the Blackstone Group. She received her bachelor's and doctorate degrees in economics from the University of California at Berkeley.</p></p><p><h2>Background </h2></p><p><p><a href="http://teresaghilarducci.org/about" target="_blank">Bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/" target="_blank">The New School for Social Research</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/" target="_blank">Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://teresaghilarducci.org/books" target="_blank">Books</a> </p></p><p><h2>The Retirement Crisis</h2></p><p><p>"<a href="http://teresaghilarducci.org/images/Backgrounder_Retirement_Crisis_Feb_14.pdf" target="_blank">The Retirement Crisis</a>," by Teresa Ghilarducci, The New School.</p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2018/02/20/whose-retirement-crisis-household-savings-or-public-financing/?sh=7f1001893d05">Whose Retirement Crisis?
