Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) go in on the courses industry. They break down the different types of course business categories, how to build them, and how to grow them. Shaan also talks about a Twitter fight he got into that got him blocked. The guys finish the episode by brainstorming on ideas ranging from "a bar-in-a-box" to selling ice to capitalizing on real estate vacancies.
