Sam (@theSamParr) and Andrew (@awilkinson) break down billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann. Lemann has built his fortune by acquiring consumer businesses and running them profitably by slashing costs. He famously sells all corporate jets when he acquires a company. The guys then get into a brainstorm on Andrew's new media company, how to create healthier babies, and "health managers".
