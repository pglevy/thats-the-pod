With Endeavor's IPO, Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) break down the UFC's numbers and how it got so profitable. Key to the whole thing: Dana White. He bought the UFC for $2m and turned it into a multi-billion empire. The guys also talk about the mental toughness of UFC fighters and how you can take some of these same principals and apply them to your life. They also talk about an interesting concept called no-loss lotteries and a company trying to save you taxes.
