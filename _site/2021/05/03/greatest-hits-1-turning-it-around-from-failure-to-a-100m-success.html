Suli Ali is one of the most interesting founders we’ve had on the pod.
Suli and his brother Moiz have started and sold $300m worth of companies. They’ve also invested in hundreds of big-name startups, thousands of real estate deals, and much more more.
He built small, silly apps. Like a Facebook app survey where you voted “most likely to wear a bunny costume”. Yet...it turned into a huge success. How?
When he sold his first company, it was doing $85 million in revenue and $15 million in profit.
In this episode, we discuss his journey from making $76k a year at Microsoft to selling his first company for $100,000,000+.
