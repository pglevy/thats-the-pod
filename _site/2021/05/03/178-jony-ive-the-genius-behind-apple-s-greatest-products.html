<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3aYRyMV">Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products</a>by Leander Kahney.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>[4:43] Mike Ive influence on his son’s talent was purely nurturing. They were constantly keeping up a conversation about made-objects and hw they could be made better.</p><p>[6:39] I came to realize that what was really important was the care that was put into it. What I really despise is when I sense some carelessness in a product.</p><p>[9:24] Take big chances. Pursue a passion. Respect the work.</p><p>[11:47] His designs were incredibly simple and elegant. They were usually rather surprising but made complete sense once you saw them. You wondered why we had never seen such a product like that before.</p><p>[15:52] <strong>Grind it out. You can make something look like magic by going further than most reasonable people would go</strong>.</p><p>[17:34] The more I learned about this cheeky, almost rebellious company (Apple) the more it appealed to me, as it unapologetically pointed to an alternative in a complacent and creatively bankrupt industry. Apple stood for something and had a reason for being that wasn’t just about making money.</p><p>[24:06] He was completely interested in humanizing technology. What something should be was always the starting point for his designs.</p><p>[33:29] <strong>Jony was very serious about his work. He had a ferocious intensity about it</strong>.</p><p>[41:52] <strong>It is very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better</strong>.</p><p>[51:38] Jobs didn't want to compete in the broader market for personal computers. These companies competed on price, not features or ease of use. Jobs figured theirs was a race to the bottom. Instead, he argued, there was no reason that well-designed, well-made computers couldn’t command the same market share ad margins as a luxury automobile. A BMW might get you to where you are going in the same way a Chevy that costs half the price, but there will always be those who will pay for the better ride in the sexier car. <strong>Why not make only first class-products with high margins so that Apple could continue to develop even better first-class products?</strong></p><p>[1:19:25] A great prompt for your thinking: What is your product better than? Are you just making a cheap laptop? Or are you making an iPad? <strong>Netbooks accounted for 20% of the laptop market. But Apple never seriously considered making one. “Netbooks aren’t better than anything,” Steve Jobs said at the time. “They’re just cheap laptops.” </strong>Jony proposed that the tablets in his lab could be Apple’s answer to the netbook.</p><p>[1:20:32] It’s great if you can find what you love to do. Finding it is one thing but then to be able to practice that and be preoccupied with it is another.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
