Canva is awesome, so why hasn't anyone pulled off Canva for video? Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) dive into the opportunities in this space and how a huge company can be built by making it easier to create videos. The guys then talk mobility. This is a huge market opportunity with companies like GOWOD and The Ready State making millions helping people improve their mobility. Next, the guys brainstorm on creating a better Linkedin and a few companies doing it.
