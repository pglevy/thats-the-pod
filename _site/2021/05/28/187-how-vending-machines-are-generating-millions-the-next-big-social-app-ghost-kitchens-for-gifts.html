There are entrepreneurs quietly generating six figures working part-time in the vending machine business. Others have been able to scale to multi-million and even multi-billion-dollar figures in the industry. Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) break down the vending machine industry with tons of numbers and exactly how some are pulling it off. The guys transition from a "boring" business to high-tech ones as they break down how Vimeo went from a College Humor project to competing with YouTube and earning an $8b valuation. They also talk about a trendy new pod that generated 500k downloads on its first day and they brainstorm on a fun concept: ghost kitchens for gifts.
