<p>There’s a common argument out there that gender differences are just the product of socialization. Implicitly and explicitly, the argument goes, culture tells men and women how men and women should behave.</p><p>My guest todayargues that the drivers of male and female behavior are little more complex than that. In fact, about 50% of the differences between men and women are rooted in our biology, beginning with how our respective brains form in utero. </p><p>Her name is Louann Brizendine. She’s a neuropsychiatrist, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and the author of two books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000URWYT8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000URWYT8&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Female Brain</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030DHPA2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0030DHPA2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Male Brain</em></a>. Today we discuss that latter work, and the trajectory the male brain takes from prenatal life through old age. </p><p>We begin our conversation discussing how a megadose of testosterone in the womb wires a male brain differently from a female brain and how that influences how boys socialize and learn during childhood. Louann then discusses how the male brain is re-structured again with another megadose of testosterone during puberty and the impact that has on a teen's behavior. She then walks us through what happens to the male brain when a man falls in love, has kids, and enters mature adulthood. </p><p>Consider this podcast an intro guide to how your brain works (assuming you’re a dude listening to this, though female listeners will also get some insights into why the males in their lives act the way they do).</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/malebrain" target="_blank">aom.is/malebrain</a>. </p>
