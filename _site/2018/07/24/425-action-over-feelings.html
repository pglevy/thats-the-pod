<p>While we often associate Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions with meditation and contemplation, there's another side to this wisdom that centers on action and can help us move through depression, anxiety, fear, and just general malaise.</p><p>My guest today is the author of a book about this action-oriented philosophy. His name is Gregg Krech, he's the co-founder of the <a href="http://todoinstitute.org/" target="_blank">ToDo Institute</a>, and his book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PR814K0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00PR814K0&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Art of Taking Action: Lessons from Japanese Psychology</em></a>.</p><p>Today on the show, Gregg and I discuss a Japanese psychological technique called Morita therapy, which concentrates on accepting instead of fixing one's thoughts and feelings, and acting in spite of them. We discuss how action can be a powerful antidote to depression, anxiety, and interpersonal conflicts, how to act when you don't feel like it, how to stay motivated when the initial rush of a new project or relationship has worn off, and why it's better to have a purpose-driven rather than a feelings-driven life. We end our conversation unpacking the idea that busyness is not the same thing as purposeful action, and why we need self-reflection to tell the difference between the two.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/artoftakingaction" target="_blank">aom.is/artoftakingaction</a>.</p>
