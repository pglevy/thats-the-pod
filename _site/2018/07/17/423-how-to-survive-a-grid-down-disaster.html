<p>We’ve all probably thought about it. What would we do and how would we fare after a societal collapse? My guest today has spent his career helping individuals get ready for such a situation. His name is James Rawles. He’s the owner of <a href="http://survivalblog.com" target="_blank">survivalblog.com</a> and the author of several bestselling books on prepping, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R2048M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002R2048M&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It</em></a>.</p><p>Today on the show, Jim and I discuss how our dependency on the power grid makes us more vulnerable to disaster than we’d like to think, and all the downstream consequences that would happen if the power grid went down for a significant amount of time, including loss of water, sewage services, and a disruption of supply chains.</p><p>We then dig into what you can do to prepare for such a situation, including securing a water supply, storing food, and the skills and mindset you need to weather a crisis. Even if you don't think you're interested in prepping, it's really interesting to think through what you'd need to do to survive an apocalyptic scenario.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/rawles" target="_blank">aom.is/rawles</a>.</p>
