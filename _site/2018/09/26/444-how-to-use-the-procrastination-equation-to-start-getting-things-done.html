<p>Procrastination can be a big stumbling block to our success in life. If you’re a student and you put off studying to the last minute, you might not do as well on a test. If you wait to start saving for retirement until you’re in your 40s, you lose out on the power of compound interest.</p><p>We know that we need to do certain things sooner, rather than later, but we don’t. Why?</p><p>My guest today is Dr. Piers Steel, and in his work and his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHUP2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003ZSHUP2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Procrastination Equation</em></a>, he's distilled all the research out there on procrastination into a kind of formula that explains why we put things off. Piers explains why his approach to procrastination is different from that taken by many psychologists, and what they often get wrong about its root causes. He then digs into the different components of why we procrastinate, as well as actionable advice on how you can mitigate these issues and start getting more stuff done.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/procrastinationequation" target="_blank">aom.is/procrastinationequation</a>.</p>
