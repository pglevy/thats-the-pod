<p>Eighteen months after the Declaration of Independence was signed, the Continental Army was on the ropes and the American Revolution was on the verge of being snuffed out. Battered, demoralized, and half-naked, 12,000 American troops marched into a small, poorly supplied encampment in British-occupied Pennsylvania to hunker down for the winter. They called the encampment Valley Forge.</p><p>Despite the terrible conditions and circumstances there, something happened at Valley Forge that would change the tide of the Revolutionary War, and the entire course of history.</p><p>My guest today is a co-author of a new book, entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501152718/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1501152718&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Valley Forge</em></a>, about this historic crucible. His name is Bob Drury, and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/wwii-pacific-theater/" target="_blank">I last had him on the show to discuss his stellar book <em>Lucky 666</em></a>. Today he explains the dire obstacles General George Washington and the Continental Army were up against at the time of Valley Forge, from coming off a string of strategic defeats to weathering political infighting. He then offers a vivid description of the squalor soldiers lived in at Valley Forge, as well as a rundown of the common myths people have about this historical episode. We end our conversation discussing how the situation at Valley Forge got turned around, and why the men who survived this crucible ended up stronger because of it.</p><p>This show will give you some fresh insights and new appreciation for this pivotal event in American history.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/valleyforge" target="_blank">aom.is/valleyforge</a>.</p>
