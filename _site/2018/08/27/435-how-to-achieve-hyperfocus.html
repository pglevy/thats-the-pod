<p>We all want to be more productive. And when we buckle down to do so, we typically try to figure out ways to better manage our time. My guest today, though, argues that focusing on managing your time is only part of the productivity picture. You also need to learn how to better manage your attention.</p><p>His name is Chris Bailey, and his latest book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077LWZC6Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B077LWZC6Q&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Hyperfocus: How to Be More Productive in a World of Distraction</em></a><em>.</em> Today on the show, Chris shares research-backed advice on how to improve your powers of concentration, and why doing so is more important than ever. We delve into why you need to be intentional about directing your attention, why multitasking actually causes you to be less productive, and the surprisingly long time it takes to get refocused when you get distracted. Chris then shares tactics you can start using today to become more focused. We then shift gears and discuss the importance of having periods of time when youâ€™re NOT focused, especially when planning for the future. Chris shares how you can organize your day to get the benefits of being both focused and unfocused.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/hyperfocus" target="_blank">aom.is/hyperfocus</a>.</p>
