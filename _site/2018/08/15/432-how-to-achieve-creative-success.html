<p>When we think of creative people, we often think of a genius who works alone, comes up with an earth-shatteringly new idea in an instantaneous eureka moment, and then sees that obviously valuable idea naturally become a well-known sensation.</p><p>My guest today argues that this picture is altogether wrong, and lays out a different image of what it really means not only to be creative, but to become a successful creative, and achieve one's aims. His name is <a href="http://allen.xyz" target="_blank">Allen Gannett</a> and heâ€™s the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075PVQ99T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B075PVQ99T&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Creative Curve</em></a>.</p><p>We begin our conversation discussing what exactly creativity is and the myth of the creative genius that exists in the West. Allen shares why the best creative ideas actually aren't completely novel and instead riff on what already exists. We discuss why the most creative people in history were the biggest consumers of other content and ideas, why creatives needs to promote their work, why timing is crucial in a creative idea taking off, and the 4 types of people a successful creative needs to have in their network.</p><p>Whether you need to be creative in traditional business or more artistic pursuits, this show has some good insights on how to make your ideas more successful.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/creativecurve" target="_blank">aom.is/creativecurve</a>.</p>
