My guest today argues that thereâ€™s a better, cheaper, and faster way to prepare for gainful employment.</p><p>His name is Ryan Craig, he's the Managing Director of <a href="http://universityventures.com" target="_blank">University Ventures</a>, an investment firm reimagining the future of higher education, and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079KHP8JD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B079KHP8JD&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>A New U: Faster + Cheaper Alternatives to College</em></a><em>.</em> We begin our conversation discussing the disconnect between a college education and the job skills employers are looking for and why higher ed continues to get more expensive each year. Ryan then digs into alternative education models that include boot camps, income-share programs, and apprenticeships that are not only faster and more affordable than college, but also put an emphasis on real-life job skills.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/anewu" target="_blank">aom.is/anewu</a>.</p>
