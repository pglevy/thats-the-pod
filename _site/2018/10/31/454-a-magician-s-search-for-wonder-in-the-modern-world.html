<p>Magicians usually become magicians because they experienced a sense of wonder seeing a cool trick as a kid, and they want to re-create that awe for audience members on a regular basis.</p><p>But what happens when a professional magician stops feeling the magic of magic?</p><p>That happened to my guest today.</p><p>His name is <a href="http://natestaniforth.com" target="_blank">Nate Staniforth</a>, and he recently wrote a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074J87L2V/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B074J87L2V&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Here is Real Magic</em></a>. Today on the show, Nate shares how he got into magic and became a professional magician, only to become disillusioned with his career. Nate then talks about how he embarked on a search to re-discover the magic of magic, which took him to the slums of India where he encountered a three-thousand-year-old clan of fire-eating street performers, and re-kindled his sense of wonder. If youâ€™re feeling burnt out from your work or disenchanted with life, this episode will have some insights for you. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/realmagic" target="_blank">aom.is/realmagic</a>.</p>
