<p>In the 1980s, when people signed up for a martial art, they probably joined a karate or taekwondo school. Today? Theyâ€™re probably signing up for a roll on the mat in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu class. And the Gracie family has played a central role in this martial art's precipitous rise. My guest today is a member of the Gracie family, the head instructor of the <a href="http://www.gracieacademy.com/" target="_blank">Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy</a>, and the co-creator of Gracie University, an online jiu-jitsu program. His name is Rener Gracie, and you may have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CGYQjC6WOY&list=PLLIasrSrFGdTYlCjogVwKwsZCoZe6CIJ8" target="_blank">the videos we made with him on our YouTube Channel a few years ago</a>.</p><p>Today, Rener walks us through the origins of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, beginning with his grandfather Helio, and how a martial art born in Japan ended up being reshaped in Brazil. He then shares how his father helped develop the UFC as a way to promote the efficacy of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, but why there's a big difference between sport BJJ and self-defense BJJ, and why BJJ is such an effective real world martial art. We end by talking about the mindset shift that occurs when you learn how to defend yourself, and how the confidence you gain from learning jiu-jitsu carries over into other aspects of life.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/gracie" target="_blank">aom.is/gracie</a>.</p>
