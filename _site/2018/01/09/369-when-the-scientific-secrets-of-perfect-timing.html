<p>When it comes to planning for success, we tend to focus on the what and the how. For example, when we set our workout goals, we’ll come up with detailed plans on what exercises we’ll do; when we come up with a debt repayment plan, we decide exactly how we’re going to pay down the debt. <br />But what if success in any endeavor isn’t only decided by the what or the how, but also the when? <br />That’s what my guest today argues in his latest book. His name is Daniel Pink, he’s the author of &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;A Whole New Mind,&quot; and &quot;To Sell is Human.&quot; In his latest book, &quot;When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing,&quot; he takes a look at how timing can affect everything from the way we make decisions to how creative we are, and even if a group will be successful in a shared task. <br />Daniel and I discuss how to use your internal clock to your advantage, why you shouldn’t get surgery done at 3PM in the afternoon, if there's really such a thing as night owls, and why you should find more opportunities to sing in a group. <br />This is a fascinating discussion that will provide plenty of cocktail party fodder, but more importantly, actionable points you can put into practice today to make yourself more effective.</p>
