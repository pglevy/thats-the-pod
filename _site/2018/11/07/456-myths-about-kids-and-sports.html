<p>Youth sports in America is a 15 billion dollar industry. A lot of that money is going towards special coaching and training and participation in elite travel teams. Parents spend an enormous amount of money and time on their kids’ involvement in sports, hoping the investment will pay off in accolades, college scholarships, and even the chance to play professionally. But my guests today argue that all that special coaching you’re spending money on probably isn’t doing much to turn your kid into an superstar.</p><p>Their names are Leonard Zaichkowsky and Daniel Peterson, and they've co-written a new book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074ZP6DY9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B074ZP6DY9&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Playmaker's Advantage</em></a>. Leonard is one of the pioneers in the field of sports psychology and was a professor of it at Boston University for 37 years. Over the decades, he’s consulted for professional and collegiate sports programs as well as Olympic teams. Daniel Peterson is a science writer who has spent his career looking at the intersection of neuroscience and athletic performance, and is co-founder and director of <a href="http://80percentmental.com" target="_blank">80 Percent Mental Consulting</a>.</p><p>Today on the show, Len and and Daniel discuss whether you can spot athletic talent in a child and why a kid who looks talented at age 10 can end up being a dud athlete at 20. They explain why you shouldn’t regiment your child's athletic training or specialize kids too early in sports. Along the way, they provide best practices for parents and coaches who work with children in sports. We then discuss how sports can boost children's cognitive abilities and why an athlete's mental game can be just as important as their speed and strength. We end our conversation talking about what kind of practice is nearly useless, and what kind is the most helpful.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/playmaker" target="_blank">aom.is/playmaker</a>.</p>
