<p>Your time on earth is finite and once you use it up, it's gone forever. Thus on the AoM podcast, we talk a lot about how to maximize your time -- how to use it more effectively to be more productive. But is it possible to be <em>too</em> concerned about managing your time? Should you also make space for chucking out all the to-do lists and schedules and just being kind of idle?</p><p>My guest would say yes. His name is Alan Lightman, heâ€™s a physicist and writer, and the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MF7J5M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B078MF7J5M&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>In Praise of Wasting Time</em></a>. Today on the show Alan forwards the sort of countercultural argument that intentionally wasting time isn't a vice but a virtue. We begin our conversation by discussing what Alan means by wasting time, and then get into how wasting time benefits our psyches, creativity, sense of mental self-reliance, and even, ironically enough, our productivity. We end our conversation discussing the difference between <em>chronos</em> time and <em>kairos</em> time, and how wasting time allows us to spend more time in the latter state.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/wastingtime" target="_blank">aom.is/wastingtime</a>.</p>
