<p>I grew up in Edmond, OK, a suburb of Oklahoma City. When I was teenager back in the 90s, I started hearing about some church being run out of a garage. Didn’t give it much thought then. Fast forward more than twenty years later, and <a href="http://life.church" target="_blank">Life.Church</a> now has over 30 campuses across 10 states, and is often ranked as the largest church in America.</p><p>Today on the show I talk to the guy who started this thing in a garage, and has stood at the helm of its tremendous growth, to glean his insights on leadership and strategy. His name is Craig Groeschel, and he’s the founder and head pastor at Life.Church. We discuss Craig's philosophy on leadership and managing the growth of a large organization, how he balances innovation with stability, how an organization can stay nimble even as it gets bigger, how you have to relinquish control in order to get growth, and why leaders need to go out of their way to show people they’re noticed and needed.</p><p>We then discuss the personal side of leadership, including how to balance work and life, how to avoid letting administrative duties kill your creativity, and how to handle criticism.</p><p>Whether you're a leader in a business or a non-profit, you’re going to find lots of actionable advice in this show.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/groeschel" target="_blank">aom.is/groeschel</a>.</p>
