<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2vuR2kV">The Wright Brothers</a> by David McCullough</p><p>---</p><p><a href="https://foundersdaily.supercast.com/">Subscribe to listen to Founders Premium</a> — Subscribers can listen to Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes and every bonus episode. </p><p><i>---</i></p><p>Unyielding determination (2:30) </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/IdTMDpizis8">Jocko's concept of GOOD</a> (4:00)</p><p>The ability to focus on an idea for a long time is the antidote to short bursts of dopamine we get from checking social feeds all day. (6:30)</p><p>The beginning of their side business (13:00)</p><p>The importance of heroes (16:00)</p><p>Rereading / revisiting old ideas (18:30)</p><p>Books transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers (22:00)</p><p>Wilbur Wright on risk: “<i>The man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positively must not take dangerous risks. Carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks</i>.” (24:30)</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/AAJOTTDjgF8">Jeff Bezos on stress</a> (25:00)</p><p>Discover things for yourself (28:00)</p><p>"<i>Success it most certainly was.</i>" (31:00)</p><p>Profitability of flying machines (33:30)</p><p>The distribution channel of flying machines (35:00) </p><p>Wilbur Wright on the idea of flight: "<i>In the enthusiasm being shown around me, I see not merely an outburst intended to glorify a person, but a tribute to an idea that has always impassioned mankind. I sometimes think that the desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their grueling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space, at full speed, above all obstacles, on the infinite highway of the air</i>."
