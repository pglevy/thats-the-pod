<p>To achieve your goals, you probably think you need one key ingredient: willpower. Grit. Self-control. Discipline. To hear a lot of self-improvement gurus tell it, if you want to get your life together, then just get it together. Just do it. </p><p>Yet while these motivational calls certainly feel good and make us pump our fists, how well does willpower-ing your way to your goals work in reality?</p><p>If you're like a lot of people, who have a string of half-finished aims heaped in the dustbin of their lives, you know the answer is: "Not very well."</p><p>My guest todayargues that there's a reason for that -- that while willpower does have a role in our lives, there's actually a better source of motivation at our disposal: our emotions. </p><p>His name is David DeSteno and he's the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7ZNXV8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01N7ZNXV8&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4&th=1" target="_blank"><em>Emotional Success: The Power of Gratitude, Compassion, and Pride</em></a>. TodayDeSteno makes the case that cultivating certain feelings will actually enhance our self-control and help us become who we want to be more than simply relying on willpower to get the job done.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/emotionalsuccess" target="_blank">aom.is/emotionalsuccess</a>.</p>
