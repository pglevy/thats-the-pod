<p>The shutdowns that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic have wreaked havoc on the global economy. Millions of people are out of work, businesses are cratering, and the stock market has tanked. Whether you've been hard hit by these effects or are so far weathering the storm yet feel uncertain about your future, what financial moves should you be making right now? To get some insight, I brought back personal finance expert <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">Ramit Sethi</a>, author of the book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GNXPP4P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07GNXPP4P&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a>. </em>Since the pandemic started, Ramit has been hosting "fireside chats" on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ramit/">his Instagram account</a> where he covers a financial topic pertinent to the pandemic, as well as answers questions from his community of followers.</p>
<p>Today we discuss some of the ideas Ramit's been hitting on during these chats as well as the common financial questions he's been fielding. I begin our conversation by asking Ramit why he tells people they shouldn't panic, but should overreact. We then dig into Ramit's advice for people who fall into different categories as to how the pandemic has affected them, beginning with survival strategies for those who are out of a job altogether. Ramit then shares the money moves people who do still have income coming in should make and why he's changed his tune on how much of an emergency fund you should have. We then discuss why now is a good time to find ways to earn more money and what investing should look like during an economic slump. We end our conversation with Ramit's advice on how to look for a job during a pandemic and what small businesses can do to adapt to the current climate.</p>
