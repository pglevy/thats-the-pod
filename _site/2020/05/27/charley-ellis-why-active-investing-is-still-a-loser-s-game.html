<p>Our guest on the podcast is investment consultant and author Charley Ellis. In 1972, Ellis founded Greenwich Associates, an investment consultant to institutional investors, government organizations, and wealthy families. His seminal book about the benefits of passive investing, <em>Winning the Loser's Game</em>, is in its seventh edition. Ellis has also authored or coauthored books about investment policy and strategy, the retirement system in the United States, and large investment firms, including Goldman Sachs and Capital Group. He has taught investment management courses at the Yale School of Management and Harvard Business School and was the successor trustee of Yale University, where he chaired the university's investment committee with David Swensen. He also served on the board of directors at The Vanguard Group. Ellis was awarded the Graham & Dodd Award of Excellence from the <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em> and is one of only 12 people recognized by the CFA Institute for lifetime contributions to the investment profession. He received his undergraduate degree from Yale College, his Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School, and his doctorate in financial economics at New York University.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong><br /></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_D._Ellis" target="_blank">Charley Ellis bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charles-D-Ellis/e/B000APHL7A/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1" target="_blank">Charley Ellis books</a> </p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf" target="_blank">The Loser's Game</a>," by Charles D.
