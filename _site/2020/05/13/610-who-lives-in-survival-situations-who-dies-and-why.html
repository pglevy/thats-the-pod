<p>In disasters or accidents, why do some people survive and others perish? In exploring this question, my guest has uncovered psychological and philosophical insights into not only dealing with life-threatening crises, but strategically navigating any situation that involves risk and decision-making. <br /><br />His name is <a href="https://laurencegonzales.com/">Laurence Gonzales</a> and he's a pilot, a journalist, and the author of several books, including the focus of today's conversation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VVMN5J2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B06VVMN5J2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why</em></a>. Today on the show, we discuss how the story of his father being shot out of the sky during WWII set Laurence on a journey to explore the mysterious underpinnings of survival. Laurence then explains what happens to us mentally and emotionally in a disaster situation that causes us to make poor decisions, how our mental models can get us in trouble, and why rule breakers are more likely to survive than rule followers. Laurence then walks us through complexity theory and how trying to make things safer can counterintuitively make them more dangerous. We then talk about why the frequency with which you yell at your kids correlates to your chances of surviving a life-threatening emergency, before ending our conversation with a discussion of the paradoxes would-be survivors must grapple with, including being both realistic and hopeful at the same time.   </p>
