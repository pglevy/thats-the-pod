<p>Studying philosophy can be a metaphorical journey into wisdom. My guest today experienced it as not only that, but as a very literal journey as well.<br /><br />His name is <a href="https://ericweinerbooks.com/">Eric Weiner</a> and he traveled thousands of miles around the world to visit the haunts of numerous philosophers as he sought to better understand their insights and how he might apply them to his own life. He wrote about this philosophic pilgrimage in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501129015/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1501129015&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">The Socrates Express: In Search of Life Lessons From Dead Philosophers</a>. </em>Eric and<em> </em>I begin our conversation with why he chose to take all his trips by train, and why rail travel is particularly conducive to thoughtful reflection. We then turn to the physical and philosophical stops he made on his journey, including why Marcus Aurelius wrote so much about getting out of bed and what ultimately motivated the emperor to start each day; what Thoreau can teach us about seeing; why Gandhi was very interested in the idea of manliness; how Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence can change the way we live our daily lives; and the lesson Simone de Beauvoir offers us on aging well. We end our conversation with Montaigne's insight on how to get comfortable with death.</p>
