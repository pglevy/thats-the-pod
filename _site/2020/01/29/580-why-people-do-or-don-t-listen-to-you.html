<p>Some cultural observers have posited that we're moving from an information economy to a reputation economy. There's so much information to sort through, that figuring out which bits to pay attention to has come to increasingly rely on what we think of the person delivering them. We privilege the messenger over the message.</p>
<p>But how exactly do we decide which messengers to listen to or not? What draws us to particular messengers and causes us to tune out others?</p>
<p>My guest has spent his career researching, lecturing, and writing about the answers to these questions and he shares his insights in a new book. His name is <a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/">Steve Martin</a> and he's the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MLRC69J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07MLRC69J&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Messengers: Who We Listen To, Who We Don't, and Why</em></a>. In the first half of our conversation, we unpack why it is that the messenger matters so much, and how people can manipulate these factors in unethical ways to peddle messages and influence that may not be credible. We then shift into how you can also leverage these neutral tools in ethical ways to make yourself more persuasive and ensure your ideas get heard. Steve explains that there are two types of persuasive messengers -- hard and soft -- and walks us through the qualities embodied by each. We discuss the different ways a person can become an effective hard messenger, including competence, dominance, and attractiveness, and what makes a soft messenger persuasive, including warmth, vulnerability, and charisma -- the latter of which incorporates a trait you may not have previously associated with being charismatic. We end our conversation discussing when you should use a hard vs. soft approach as you seek to lead and share your message.</p>
