<p>We're a month into the new year now. How are you doing on your resolutions? Have you already fallen off the wagon? Maybe the goal you set for yourself was just too big to successfully tackle. You need to think smaller. Tiny, even.</p>
<p>That's the argument my guest makes. His name is <a href="https://www.bjfogg.com/">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, and he's the founder and director of Stanford's Behavior Design Lab, as well as the author of the new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0358003326/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0358003326&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change Everything</em></a>. Today on the show, BJ walks us through the three components that drive our behavior, including the simple yet overlooked relationship between motivation and ability. He then explains how to build habits that feel easier and require lower levels of motivation by picking behaviors that are good matches for you and breaking them down into smaller parts. We also talk about the need to tie your habits to turnkey prompts, the importance of celebrating your successes, no matter how small, and the way tiny habits can lead to bigger changes. We end our conversation with why you should think about the process of getting rid of your bad habits as untangling them rather than breaking them.  </p>
