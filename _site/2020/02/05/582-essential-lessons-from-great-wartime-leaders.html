<p>War puts leadership to the ultimate test. During a war, a leader must make life or death decisions and be held accountable for those decisions while grappling not only with military strategy, but also political, economic, and domestic dynamics.</p>
<p>My guest explores the lives of nine wartime leaders and what we can learn from them in his latest book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525522387/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525522387&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Leadership in War: Essential Lessons From Those Who Made History</em></a>. His name is <a href="http://andrew-roberts.net/">Andrew Roberts</a>, and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-544-the-audacious-life-of-winston-churchill/">we last had him on the show to talk about his biography of Winston Churchill</a>. We begin today's conversation discussing how Andrew decided on the leaders to highlight in his book, how he defines a "great" leader, and how that definition includes nefarious dictators like Hitler and Stalin. We then take a look at the leadership style of Napoleon, as well as that of World War II leaders like Churchill, Eisenhower, and Marshall. We also unpack how Hitler and Stalin gained power, despite having serious character defects. We end our conversation with the qualities this varied set of leaders held in common.</p>
