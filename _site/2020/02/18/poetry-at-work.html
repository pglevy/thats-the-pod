<p>Some of our most famous poets had day jobs: Robert Burns was a tax collector; William Carlos Williams was a doctor; Audre Lorde was a librarian and professor. Poetry has a lot to say about work and can serve as a meeting place, a provocative memo, or a break from the daily grind. In this episode, we hear from the creator of Poetry At Work Day and the editor of Poetry magazine about the power of verse in the workplace. And some Basecamp colleagues share poems that are meaningful to them.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p><a href='https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/2020/02/18/'>Days of the Year</a> - 00:08</p><p><a href='https://saltypineapple.ca/blogs/pineapple-express/who-created-the-be-a-pineapple-quote'>The origins of &quot;Be A Pineapple&quot;</a> - 00:55</p><p><a href='https://www.tweetspeakpoetry.com/poetry-at-work-day/'>Poetry At Work Day 2020</a> - 2:00</p><p><a href='https://www.tweetspeakpoetry.com/take-your-poet-to-work-day/'>Take Your Poet to Work Day</a>  - 2:18</p><p>Laura Barkat&apos;s <a href='http://llbarkat.com/'>website</a> | <a href='http://twitter.com/llbarkat'>Twitter</a> - 2:26</p><p><a href='https://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/amverse/BAD0508.0001.001/1:36?rgn=div1;view=fulltext'>&quot;The African Chief&quot;</a> by William Cullen Bryant - 2:45</p><p><a href='https://www.tweetspeakpoetry.com/'>Tweetspeak Poetry</a> - 3:06</p><p><a href='https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/408/selected-poems-jz5mf7'>&quot;Wasp&quot;</a> by Tony Hoagland - 4:12</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/don-share'>Don Share</a> | <a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine'><em>Poetry</em> magazine</a> - 5:04</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47766/the-instruction-manual'>&quot;The Instruction Manual&quot;</a> by John Ashbery - 5:22</p><p><a href='http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14525'>&quot;Toads&quot;</a> by Philip Larkin - 6:22</p><p><a href='https://rework.fm/you-never-forget-george-pappageorge/'>Our recent episode</a> about moving out of Basecamp&apos;s current office - 6:57</p><p><a href='https://poets.org/poem/my-first-memory-librarians'>&quot;My First Memory (of Librarians)&quot;</a> by Nikki Giovanni - 7:06</p><p><a href='http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/sentimnt/snpohwla1t.html'>&quot;Evangeline&quot;</a> by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow - 8:08</p><p>Tweetspeak Poetry&apos;s <a href='https://www.tweetspeakpoetry.com/every-day-poems/'>Daily Poem email</a> - 11:58</p><p>The Poetry Foundation&apos;s <a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/series/74634/audio-pod'>Audio Poem of the Day</a> - 12:05</p><p><a href='https://www.slowdownshow.org/'>The Slowdown podcast</a> - 12:11</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148574/on-clothes'>&quot;On Clothes&quot;</a> by Kahlil Gibran - 13:15</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say'>&quot;This Is Just To Say&quot;</a> by William Carlos Williams - 14:41</p><p><a href='https://www.vox.com/2017/12/1/16723210/this-is-just-to-say-plums-twitter-baby-shoes'>&quot;This is just to say we have explained the plum jokes in your Twitter feed&quot;</a> (Vox) - 14:56</p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters'>Lotus-eaters</a> (Wikipedia) - 15:43</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45364/the-lotos-eaters'>&quot;The Lotos-eaters&quot;</a> by Alfred, Lord Tennyson - 15:59</p><p><a href='https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58264/a-ritual-to-read-to-each-other'>&quot;A Ritual to Read to Each Other&quot;</a> by William E.
