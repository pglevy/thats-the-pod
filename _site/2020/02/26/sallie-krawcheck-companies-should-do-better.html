<p><p>Our guest on the podcast today been called one of the most powerful women in finance. Sallie Krawcheck started her career as an equity analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, where her reputation for impartial advice and criticism of conflicts of advice in the financial-services sector prompted <em>Fortune</em> magazine to call her the last honest analyst. She later moved to Citigroup, where she served as CEO of the firm's Smith Barney unit, Citi's chief financial officer, and CEO of Citi's, Wealth Management Business. In the latter role, she was an early advocate of a fiduciary standard for the brokerage industry. She went on to Bank of America where she served as president of the firm's wealth management unit. Sallie is currently the CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial advisor for women launched in 2016. She is also owner and chair of Ellevate Network, a global network of women committed to promoting gender equality in the workplace. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>In the spirit of full disclosure, Morningstar Inc. invested in Ellevest in 2015 and 2019, and Morningstar Investment Management LLC, a subsidiary of Morningstar Inc. provides consulting services to Ellevest for their core portfolios.
