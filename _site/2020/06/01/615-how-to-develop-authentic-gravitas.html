<p>When it comes to how you're perceived in your professional life, it's likely you want to be taken seriously. You want your words to carry weight. You want to be influential and listened to, regardless of your position in a company. You want to carry yourself with gravitas.<br /><br />My guest today is an organizational psychologist and executive coach who explains how to cultivate this quality in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FZQ1VRC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07FZQ1VRC&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Authentic Gravitas: Who Stands Out and Why</em></a>. Her name is <a href="https://rebeccanewton.co.uk/authenticgravitas/">Rebecca Newton</a> and we begin our conversation together by delving into the traits that go into embodying gravitas, as well as the myths we have about this quality. We discuss how gravitas doesn't necessarily include confidence and charisma, as well as its false manifestations. Rebecca then walks us through the steps to carrying yourself with gravitas in meetings and presentations, including why you should script the beginning and end of your speeches, and how to put more gravitas into your voice and words. We also discuss what to focus on when you're pulled into an impromptu conversation, how to get real feedback about how you can improve the way you carry yourself, and how to convey gravitas in online communication. We then discuss why practicing self-leadership is so important to developing gravitas, why Rebecca thinks everyone needs to create a "personal thought leadership window," and how you can use your drive to and from work to become more thoughtful and reflective. We end our conversation with the questions you should start asking yourself today to develop more gravitas.</p>
