<p>We've all been there: you're sitting at home some evening and you don't have plans, you haven't heard from family or friends for awhile, and you've got things on your mind, but don't feel like there's anyone you can talk to about them. You feel down and adrift, and sense an almost physical ache in your heart. You're experiencing loneliness, and my guest today says we ought to interpret this feeling the way we would hunger or thirst -- as a signal that we have a need that we should take action to fulfill. </p>
<p>His name is <a href="https://www.vivekmurthy.com/">Dr. Vivek Murthy</a>, he served as the 19th Surgeon General of the United States, and he's the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062913298/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062913298&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing what loneliness is exactly and how we can feel interpersonally fulfilled in some areas of our lives, and yet lonely in others. Vivek then walks us through the very tangible harm loneliness can do to our mental health, before exploring why loneliness has been increasing in the western world. Vivek and I then discuss how loneliness affects men in particular. We end our conversation with things we can all do to battle the loneliness epidemic and feel more connected to those around us. </p>
