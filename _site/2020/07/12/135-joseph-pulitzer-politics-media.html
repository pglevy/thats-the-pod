<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38OM5pz">Pulitzer: A Life in Politics, Print, and Power </a>by James McGrath Morris.</p><p>----</p><p>Come see a live show with me and Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Invest Like The Best on October 19th in New York City. </p><p><a href="https://www.axs.com/events/498660/founder-mentality-patrick-oyshaughnessy-david-senra-tickets?skin=websterhall">Get your tickets here</a>! </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://foundersdaily.supercast.com/">Subscribe to listen to Founders Premium</a> — Subscribers can listen to Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes and every bonus episode. </p><p><i>---</i></p><p>[0:20]  Joseph Pulitzer was the midwife to the birth of the modern mass media. Pulitzer’s lasting achievement was to transform American journalism into a medium of mass consumption and immense influence. </p><p>[3:04] He was the pioneer of the modern media industry.  </p><p>[5:06] Teddy Roosevelt tried to have Joseph Pulitzer put in jail.  </p><p>[7:11] How one of Pulitzer’s adult sons viewed him: One of the strange differences between us two is the fact that you have never come near learning how to enjoy life. </p><p>[9:42] Joseph favored reading works of history and biography.  </p><p>[10:12] Joseph understood fully the extent of the calamity [his father’s death]. He had been 9 years old when his older brother died, 10 when his younger brother and sister died, 11 when his father died, and 13 at the death of his last sister. </p><p>[11:50] At 17 years old Joseph escapes to America. A group of wealthy Boston businessmen recruit thousands of young Europeans to fight for the Union in the American Civil War. This scheme became Pulitzer’s escape route. </p><p>[13:18] Describing how he came to the United States: <strong>He was friendless, homeless, tongueless, and guideless.</strong>  </p><p>[14:05]  <strong>One of the places he slept when he was homeless was in the lobby of a hotel. They kept kicking him out. Later in life he buys the hotel. </strong></p><p>[14:44] What he said about his job of tending mules: Never in my life did I have a more trying task. The man who has not cared for 16 mules does not know what work and trouble are.  </p><p>[15:18] Pulitzer was a voracious reader. When he was not working he spent every free minute improving his mind.  </p><p>[17:12]  Edwin Land said, "Anything worth doing is worth doing to excess". Joseph Pulitzer would have agreed with that. </p><p>[19:15]He was so industrious that he became a positive annoyance to others who felt less inclined to work. Pulitzer was unwilling to put forward anything but his best effort. </p><p>[25:10] In only 5 years he had grown from a bounty hunting Hungarian teenager to an American lawmaker.  </p><p>[28:54] There are only two or three human stories and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they have never happened before.  </p><p>[38:10] He is 30 years old and depressed. In the best of circumstances the loss of one’s only surviving parent inspires self-reflection, for Joseph with no specific profession or even a home, such introspection was demoralizing.  </p><p>[40:45] It is hard to understand how much money newspapers made, especially at this time. William Randolph Hearst’s net worth would be the equivalent of $30 billion today.  </p><p>[48:34] One did not work with Pulitzer. For him, surely. Against him, often. But not with him.  </p><p>[51:44] Pulitzer was extremely ambitious. He was not satisfied to be the 500th best newspaper. He wanted to be number 1.  </p><p>[1:06:20] When we think that, a hundred years hence, not one of us now living will be alive to care or to know, to enjoy or to suffer, what does it all amount to? To a puff of smoke which makes a few rings and then disappears into nothingness and yet we make tragedies of our lives, most of us not even making them serious comedies. </p><p>————</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
