<p>You're lying in bed at night and hear a noise downstairs. Is there someone in your house, and if there is, do you know what to do?</p>
<p>While we'd like to think we'd rise to the occasion and readily dispatch with the bad guys, my guest today argues that without preparation and training, you're likely to flounder, and that you should have put more thought into how to keep the invader out of your house in the first place.</p>
<p>His name is <a href="https://vistelar.com/">Dave Young</a>, and he's a security expert and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MD0QLE4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01MD0QLE4&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>How to Defend Your Family and Home: Outsmart an Invader, Secure Your Home, Prevent a Burglary and Protect Your Loved Ones from Any Threat</em></a>. We begin our conversation with how Dave got involved with security training, the intensive field research he did for his book, and the basic equation criminals use in deciding whether or not to make your house a target. We then delve into how to tweak that equation in your favor, beginning with casing your house like a criminal would; we go over the vulnerabilities to look for as you walk the perimeter of your property, and the actionable changes to make to deter would-be home invaders. Dave then walks us through what to do if someone does invade your home, including the criteria to use in picking a place to hide, choosing a weapon to fight back, and selecting an engagement point to confront the intruder. We also get into the importance of firearm training, if you decide to own a gun for self-defense. We end our conversation with an oft-overlooked part of surviving a home invasion: the months and years of psychological and judicial aftermath. </p>
