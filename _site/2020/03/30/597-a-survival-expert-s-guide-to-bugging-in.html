<p>The coronavirus pandemic has forced tens of millions of people to stay home due to shelter-in-place orders and even lockdowns. While supplies of food, water, and other essentials have largely continued undisrupted, if one or more of these services were cut off, what would be the best way to prepare for that kind of emergency?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I talk to friend of AoM and survival expert, <a href="http://www.creekstewart.com/">Creek Stewart</a>. Creek has dedicated his life to mastering all things survival, spending thousands of hours in the field, authoring <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/?s=Creek+stewart">numerous articles</a> and books, teaching courses to others, and hosting television shows for the Weather Channel like <em>SOS: How to Survive</em>.</p>
<p>Today, Creek and I talk about what we can learn from the current pandemic about how to shelter-in-place or bug-in, and how to be prepared if this crisis worsens in severity, or we're one day hit with a more dire disaster. We dive into the different bug-in categories you need to consider, beginning with how much food and water you need for a long-term bug-in situation, and how to properly store it. Creek then talks about what you need to consider in terms of first aid and home defense in a bug-in scenario, and why you also need to think about how to keep yourself entertained.</p>
