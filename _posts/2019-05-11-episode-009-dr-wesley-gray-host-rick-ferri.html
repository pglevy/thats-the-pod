<p>Dr. Wesley R. "Wes" Gray is my guest in Episode 9, and our focus is on "factor" investing. Dr. Gray is the CEO of <a href='https://alphaarchitect.com/'>Alpha Architect</a>, an author, portfolio manager, United States Marine, Iraq War vet, and a former professor of finance at Drexel University.

He is a contributor to multiple industry publications and regularly speaks to professional investor groups across the country. Dr. Gray has published multiple academic papers and four books, including Embedded (Naval Institute Press, 2009), Quantitative Value (Wiley, 2012), DIY Financial Advisor (Wiley, 2015), and Quantitative Momentum (Wiley, 2016). His research-intensive asset management firm focuses on high-conviction value and momentum factor exposures.</p>
