<p>My guest today is Antony Cummins, and we talk about his book &quot;True Path of the Ninja.&quot;<br />Today on the show, Antony uncovers the biggest myths we have in the West about ninjas -- like the fact that there isnâ€™t really a ninjutsu fighting system, nor were samurai the ninjas' sworn enemy -- and then gives the real history of these ancient warriors. Antony then shares what lessons actual ninjas can teach us folks living in the modern West about psychology and interacting with others in business and life.<br />The bad news is that we're going to ruin your childhood conceptions about ninjas in this podcast, but the good news is that the real story of ninjas is even more fascinating.</p>
