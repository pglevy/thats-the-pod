<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3DNBedS">Onassis: An Extravagant Life</a> by Frank Brady. </p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>He became one of the richest men in U.S. history ever to be arrested.<br /><br />The epic life of Aristotle Onassis is as mysterious as a tale from ancient Greek mythology and is a study of paradoxes, altogether gripping because of their seeming inconsistencies.<br /><br />Onassis had long since begun to formulate a personal business philosophy. The key to success was boldness, boldness, and more boldness.<br /><br />He was constantly visiting and inspecting ships, talking to ship owners and other importers and quietly absorbing everything, making a very conscious attempt to learn as much as he could before going into ship-owning seriously.<br /><br />He was quite observant about what, to others, were trifles but, to him, were important details.

He could keep a dinner party of some of the world's most sophisticated conversationalists spellbound.<br /><br />Onassis spent almost all of his time working. He would pore over shipping journals from Antwerp, Vancouver, Hamburg, and New York, looking for intelligence, trends, and opportunities. He would scan, study and memorize tonnage, prices, insurance rates and schedules of the world's great and small steamship companies and then attempt to outbid his competitors. He read the maritime sections of at least six foreign language daily newspapers each day.<br /><br />And I, of course, will do exactly as I please.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
