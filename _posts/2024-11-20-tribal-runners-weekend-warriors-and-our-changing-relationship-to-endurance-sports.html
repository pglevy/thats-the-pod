<p>Endurance activities, like distance running, have existed since ancient times. But humans' relationship to those pursuits has changed, according to time and place. In the West, we've currently turned endurance sports into a science — tracking every metric and chasing personal records through sophisticated technology and personalized training plans. But as my guest, who's spent years studying the running cultures in different societies, knows well, this modern, individualized, data-driven approach isn't the only way to pursue the art of endurance.</p><p>Michael Crawley is a competitive runner, social anthropologist, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4i36cUi"><i>To the Limit</i></a>. On the show today, we first examine how Western athletes have "workified" running through technology and social media. We then look at how other cultures approach running differently, including why East African runners emphasize group training over individual goals and how the Rarámuri people of Mexico incorporate spiritual dimensions into their running. We end our conversation with how we might rediscover more meaningful, holistic ways to approach our own physical pastimes.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-1021-you-were-born-to-run/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #1,021: You Were Born to Run</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3O8CYFQ" target="_blank"><i>Born to Run</i> by Christopher McDougall</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Michael Crawley</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://x.com/mphcrawley?lang=en" target="_blank">Michael on X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mikecrawl/?hl=en" target="_blank">Michael on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/michael-p-crawley/" target="_blank">Michael's faculty page</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/11/81jOdCN058L._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Cover of "To The Limit" by Michael Crawley, showcasing tribal runners navigating a rugged trail with mountains in the background." />
