<p>What I learned from rereading <a href="https://amzn.to/3zV5WT0">Autobiography of a Restless Mind: Reflections on the Human Condition Volume 1</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3vzzOBN">Autobiography of a Restless Mind: Reflections on the Human Condition Volume 2</a> by Dee Hock.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[4:39] Quotes: <a href="https://youtu.be/U93NR-t9ZH4">Abraham Lincoln</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/k6lIx41uAJE">Pythagoras</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/RmEY88jfPMc">Mark Twain</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/VR19h_X0B9w">Socrates</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/xMcT5m-LZrw">Napoleon</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/XalMgqFVFpo">Leonardo da Vinci</a></p><p>[6:15] One should not read like a dog obeying its master, but like an eagle hunting its prey.</p><p>[6:48] Humility and generosity have no enemies.</p><p>[7:12] Powerful writing should take one side and stick to it tenaciously, ignoring the other even though it may have merit. Objective writing is impotent.</p><p>[8:02] The essential reward of anything well done is to have done it.</p><p>[8:07] What becomes known is worthless until it is shared.</p><p>[9:25] No dream is so great as the person you might become by remaining true to it.</p><p>[11:04] The wise make great use of adversity. The foolish whine about it.</p><p>[12:02] Impatience is a perpetual barrier between desire and realization.</p><p>[12:46] There are two ways to look at opposition: I want to do it and they will not let me or they want to prevent me and I won’t let them.</p><p>[13:54] When we fully attend to management of self, excellent management of all else is unavoidable.</p><p>[14:43] A meaningful life cannot be made from denial. It must be made from affirmation.</p><p>[15:16] We are each the author of our own life. Whatever we write, masterpiece or trash, it will be published and widely read throughout our life and for decades thereafter.</p><p>[16:21] The wise do not feel demeaned by asking for advice or diminished by following it.</p><p>[16:37] A wise man goes forth to meet difficulty on rather than agonizing at its approach.</p><p>[21:27] Superb design and sluggish effort can never compete with modest design and diligent effort.</p><p>[21:45] It is both foolish and weak to defer confronting what cannot be avoided.</p><p>[22:04] I have done many great things perfectly—the ones I imagined but never attempted.</p><p>[22:09] Delaying what we must do eventually does nothing but lengthen the time and distance we must carry the burden.</p><p>[22:30] The most interesting people are always the most interested people.</p><p>[22:54] Complaining about life is like hurling sand against the wind.</p><p>[23:31] Beginning of Volume 2</p><p>[27:29] Certainty is not a property of the universe. It is a construct of the mind.</p><p>[28:09] Any idiot can impose and exercise control. It takes genius to ensure freedom and release creativity.</p><p>[29:18] Two centuries ago it took a year to send a message around the globe. Now it takes a fraction of a second. We have no idea what this means or what the consequences may be.</p><p>[30:04] “Use your head, but follow your heart.” is my advice to all my grandchildren. Come to think of it. It's not bad advice for adults as well.</p><p>[30:54] Man is at war with his own nature.</p><p>[31:12] There is nothing at all wrong with discipline providing it is self-induced rather than imposed.</p><p>[31:26] Books are seductive things. All are worth a look and a touch, some a kiss, others an affair, the best marriage and lifelong devotion.</p><p>[32:41] Genius merely articulates what your heart already knows.</p><p>[32:45] The young hurl themselves into vast problems that have troubled the world's best thinkers, believing that they can find a solution. It is well that they should for, from time to time, one of them does.</p><p>[33:20] Great accomplishment often consists of doing little things well.</p><p>[33:35] The superior man is concerned when his deeds are not better than his words.</p><p>[34:16] Books are not dead things. They preserve some thing of the intellect and spirit that writes, and are instrumental in forming the intellect and spirit that reads.</p><p>[34:42] Ignorant commentaries corrupt brilliant thoughts. That may well prove to be the curse of the internet.</p><p>[35:44] Conduct is a silent sermon powerfully preached without cessation.</p><p>[36:02] Every organization has one or two heroes who gives it birth, direction, and purpose.</p><p>[36:20] Minnows of thought dart about in shallow minds with great agitation. Great whales of thought majestically move through oceanic minds without commotion.</p><p>[38:00] The new and novel should be viewed with suspicion. For it is improbable that one generation can be wiser than all ancestors combined.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
