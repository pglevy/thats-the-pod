Our teacher today is John Crowley. It is difficult to appropriately describe John and the Crowley family's story without drawing comparisons to superheroes. Harrison Ford gave it a shot, and the result is Extraordinary Measures, a blockbuster movie he starred in, alongside Brendan Fraser and Kerry Russell.
The movie is based on Gita Anand's book The Cure, which tells the story of John and his wife's journey to save two of their children from a then-untreatable disease called Pompe. Thanks to John, that's no longer the case, and now more than 20 years later, both of his children and many others with Pompe are not only still living, but thriving.
Since that time, John's gone on to build several successful biotech companies, including Amicus Therapeutics and Novozyme. And just a few days before the release of this class, it was announced that John is now the new CEO of Biotechnology Innovation Organization, or BIO, which is the leading biotech advocacy, education, and policy organization in the world.
There's nobody more purpose-built to give us a history lesson on the biotech industry. Please enjoy this class with the incredible John Crowley.
