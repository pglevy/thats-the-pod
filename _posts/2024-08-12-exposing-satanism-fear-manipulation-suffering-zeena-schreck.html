<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with ex-high priestess of the Church of Satan and daughter of Anton LaVey, Zeena Schreck. They discuss her upbringing in the church, the pathology of her mother and father, how and why she severed ties, and the spirituality she has come to know today.</p><p> </p><p>Zeena Schreck is a Berlin-based interdisciplinary artist, musician, and writer. Prior to her solo music career, she was musical co-director and graphic art designer for the experimental musical project Radio Werewolf during its most prolific European phase. She is also an ordained Tibetan Buddhist yogini and leading Western teacher of Buddhist meditation, spiritual awakening, and the nature of mind. She brings to her creative work a lifetime's experience and expertise in both ancient magical traditions as well as still-living, unbroken Tibetan Buddhist traditions. She expatriated from the U.S. in 1990, living first in Vienna, Austria, and since 1999 in Berlin, Germany.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Zeena Schreck:</p><p> </p><p>Website and blog https://www.zeenaschreck.com/blog</p><p> </p><p>FAQ https://www.zeenaschreck.com/general-info.html</p><p> </p><p>Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeena_Schreck</p><p> </p><p>Instagram https://www.instagram.com/zeenaschreck_art/</p><p> </p><p>Bandcamp https://zeenaschreck.bandcamp.com/</p><p> </p><p>YouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/ZeenaSchreckOfficial</p><p> </p><p>Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ZEENA.Official.ZeenaSchreck</p><p> </p><p>Etsy https://www.etsy.com/de/shop/KCHforZeenaSchreck</p>
