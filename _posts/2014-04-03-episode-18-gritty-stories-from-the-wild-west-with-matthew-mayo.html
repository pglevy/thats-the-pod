<p>Welcome back to the Art of Manliness Podcast!<br />In this week's episode we talk to author Matthew Mayo. Matt has recently written a book called Cowboys, Mountain Men, and Grizzly Bears: Fifty of the Grittiest Moments in the History of the Wild West. We discuss Hugh Glass and his 350 mile crawl of revenge to kill the men who left him for dead, lawman Bass Reeves, the first African-American U.S. Marshall west of the Mississippi, and many more manly men who helped tame the Wild West. Listen in!</p>
