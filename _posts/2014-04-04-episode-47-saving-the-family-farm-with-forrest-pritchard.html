<p>In today's podcast we talk to Forrest Pritchard, farmer at Smith Meadows Farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He's recently published a book entitled Gaining Ground: A Story of Farmer's Markets, Local Food, and Saving the Family Farm. Forrest and I discuss his story of how he saved a farm that's been in his family for eight generations using sustainable farming practices.</p>
