<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Dr. Jared Ross from the Do No Harm organization. They discuss the horrifying - and true - statistics around transgender care, the 12 children’s hospitals most responsible for pushing this ideology on children, the specifics of the surgeries involved, and what over 12,000 concerned physicians, victims, and citizens are doing in response.</p><p> </p><p>Jared has been a first responder, EMT, paramedic, firefighter, SWAT team member, and an Emergency Medical Services educator. When the organization “Do No Harm” spoke with him, he had just returned from providing on-site safety and medical services at the Arizona Flying Circus, an event with aviation, pyrotechnics, flame throwers, and firearms. The week after, he planned to work in an emergency room at a city hospital.</p><p> </p><p>The scope of scenarios that Jared encounters in these environments is wide, but they all have one thing in common: They are urgent. He worries the creep of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) into the medical field will poison the dynamic between people in crisis and those trying to save them.</p><p> </p><p>This episode was filmed on October 14th, 2024</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>| Links |</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Jared Ross:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://x.com/jared999?lang=en</p><p> </p><p>Do No Harm website https://donoharmmedicine.org/</p><p> </p><p>Stop the Harm Database https://stoptheharmdatabase.com/ </p>
