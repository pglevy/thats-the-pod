Michael Birch sold his social networking site to AOL for $850M....and then bought it back for $1M years later. (buy low, sell high. boys and girls). His business portfolio is impressive. He's an early investor in companies like Calm and Pinterest, owns two giant hotels, and bought a private island off of Richard Branson. Despite all that success, he's a down to earth guy, and in this podcast he talks through his early struggles and failed ideas before he had his billion dollar breakthrough and reminisces his days being head to head with Zuckerberg.
