<p>Welcome back to another edition of the Art of Manliness podcast. In this episode we return to our series called &quot;Man Stories&quot; where we interview a different man every other week and ask him what it mean for him to be a man. Our guest this week is Dan Kern. Dan hails from Winnipeg, Canada and he works as a voice actor for a living.</p>
