<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with author and podcaster, Michael Malice. They discuss his latest book, “The White Pill.” From this they explore the philosophy of Ayn Rand, anarchism, the history and rebranded atrocities of Czarist Russia, and why utopian visions cyclically entice generations of people, despite leaving each one devastated for their commitment.</p><p> </p><p>Michael Malice is the author of “Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il” and The New Right: A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics,” “The White Pill,” and organizer of “The Anarchist Handbook.” He is also the subject of the graphic novel “Ego & Hubris,” written by the late Harvey Pekar of American Splendor fame.
