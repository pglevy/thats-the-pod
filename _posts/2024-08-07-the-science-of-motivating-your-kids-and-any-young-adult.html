<p>If you’re a parent, teacher, coach, or manager who lives, loves, and works with tweens, teens, and 20s-somethings, you know that young people sometimes act in seemingly head-scratching ways, that you don’t always feel like you’re being listened to, and that it can be frustrating to try to guide them in acting towards positive ends.</p><p>The source of these challenges is often chalked up to the underdeveloped brains and hormones that tweens through young twenty-somethings possess. But my guest would say that what’s more to blame is the ineffective way mentors often approach young adults.</p><p>David Yeager is a developmental psychologist and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3WVTSwB"><i>10 to 25: The Science of Motivating Young People: A Groundbreaking Approach to Leading the Next Generation—And Making Your Own Life Easier</i></a>. Today on the show, David and I discuss the “mentor’s dilemma” — the idea that you either have to be a tough authoritarian who holds young adults to high standards or a softie push-over who doesn’t crush a kid’s spirit — and how to navigate through this unnecessary dichotomy. David explains the critical importance of understanding what really drives young adults, what approaches cause them to shut down and disengage, and the best practices that parents, teachers, and other mentors can take to leave young adults feeling inspired, enthusiastic, and ready to contribute.</p><h2><strong>Connect With David Yeager</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://txbspi.prc.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Texas Behavioral Science and Policy Institute</a></li><li><a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/faculty/yeagerds" target="_blank">David’s faculty page</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/08/61lJ29UeztL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" width="325" />
