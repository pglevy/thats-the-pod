<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Scott Jensen walk through his accomplished professional life in family medicine, as well as his successful run as a Minnesota senator, all before having his reputation in both fields dismantled for what may be purely political reasons. Six investigations across nearly five years and numerous allegations without cohesion, proof, or relation have amounted to nothing, save for the clarification of Dr. Jensen's newest goal: to take on the medical board that had no justification for its actions. Given the parallels between Dr. Jensen and Dr. Peterson’s experiences, this interview was not only inevitable but paramount.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Scott Jensen has practiced family medicine in Carver County, Minnesota, for 35 years. Jensen then served in the Minnesota Senate (2017-2021) and was vice-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, as well as the Republican Governor candidate in the 2022 election.</p><p> </p><p>He has served many organizations as a board member or chair including the Waconia School Board, numerous Rotary and Lions clubs, several Chambers of Commerce, and bank boards. He is an avid pilot and writer, publishing his first book in 2015, “Relationship Matters” and his second book, “We’ve Been Played” in 2022. In 2001, he founded Catalyst Medical Clinic which now has offices located in Watertown and Chaska.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Scott Jensen:</p><p> </p><p>Website: https://drscottjensen.com/</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/drscottjensen</p><p>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrScottJensen</p><p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottJensen</p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drscottjensenmn/</p><p>Rumble: https://rumble.com/c/DrScottJensen</p><p> </p><p>Read these books by Dr. Scott Jensen</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve Been Played: Exposing the Triad of Terror” https://drscottjensenbook.com/</p><p> </p><p>“Relationship Matters” https://www.amazon.com/RELATIONSHIP-MATTERS-FOUNDATION-MEDICAL-FRACTURING-ebook/dp/B014JX46H6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1681494801&sr=8-1 </p>
