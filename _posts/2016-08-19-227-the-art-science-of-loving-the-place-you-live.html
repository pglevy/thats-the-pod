<p>How can you learn to love the place you live, even if you don’t feel it's the place of your dreams, or the most ideal location?<br />My guest today spent a year researching the burgeoning science of what's called &quot;place attachment&quot; in order to answer that question. Her name is Melody Warnick and she’s the author of This Is Where You Belong: The Art and Science of Loving the Place You Live. On the show Melody and I discuss what “place attachment” is and what you can do to have more of it for the place you live. This is a great podcast filled with some extremely actionable advice.</p>
