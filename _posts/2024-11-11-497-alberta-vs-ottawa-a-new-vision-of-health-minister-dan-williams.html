<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Canada’s Minister of Mental Health and Addiction, Dan Williams. They discuss how Canada became the epicenter of the world’s opioid crisis, the federal approach that only enables further addiction, the demoralization of Canadians as the country’s future continues to destabilize, and the efforts needed to right the ship — before it is too late.</p><p> </p><p>Dan Williams was sworn in as the Minister of Mental Health and Addiction on June 9, 2023. He was first elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Peace River on April 16, 2019, and was reelected on May 29, 2023. Minister Williams has been tasked with implementing Alberta’s mental health and addiction strategy, known as the Alberta Recovery Model. This policy model focuses on the fact that recovery is possible, no matter what addiction or mental health challenge someone may face. Under his leadership, Alberta is building 11 recovery communities across the province, a record-breaking expansion to long-term addiction treatment. He has connected with communities, First Nations, and families dealing with the addiction crisis. Alberta has now established a new mental health and addiction agency, Recovery Alberta, which is funded and overseen by the Minister of Mental Health and Addiction. The province, under Minister Williams, is also investing in mental health services, especially for children and youth. Partnerships with service providers are expanding services across the entire province and connecting families with the mental health support they need.</p><p> </p><p>This episode was filmed on October 31st, 2024.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>| Links |</p><p> </p><p>For Minister Dan Williams:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://x.com/DanWilliamsAB</p><p> </p><p>On Youtube https://youtube.com/@danwilliamsab?si=b5IvXW7t-XHDo285</p><p> </p><p>On Facebook https://m.facebook.com/DanWilliamsPeaceCountry/</p>
