<p>In April, Basecamp Support team member James Glazebrook gave a talk at <a href='https://supportdriven.com/sdexpo-europe-2019/'>Support Driven Expo Europe</a> about Everyone On Support.

James noticed the system—while well-intentioned—wasn&apos;t working properly, and set out to fix it. And that, as James himself might say, is pretty metal.</p>
