Sam Parr (@theSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) discuss Shaan's recent trip to Disneyland and talk about a number of business ideas that involve unbundling Disney. They also talk about PFP NFT projects, why CNN is just like the WWE, YouTube creator camps, and much more. At the end of the episode, they pick six $1,000 winners from the recent review contest, so if you submitted a review, stick around to see if you won.
