<p>This episode was recorded on 03/12/21</p><p>I had the pleasure of inviting Jocko Willink on to my podcast for the first time, I’ve been on Jocko’s podcast several times in the past and now get the opportunity to reverse the interviewing role to learn more about his life and endeavors. We discuss his experience in the military and war exploring time in the Navy Seals, Afganistan, and Iraq. Jocko recount what it looks like to be on the ground in combat scenarios and the requirement of strong leadership in the Seal teams. I ask him about his formative years growing up with a warrior personality. We cover other engaging points of interest in his kid books, time as an English major, restarting a clothing line in a dying factory town, and much more.</p><p>Jocko Willink is an American author, podcaster, and retired naval officer who served in the Navy SEALs.
