<p>If you had to launch your thing in just two weeks what would you cut out? Put off anything you don&apos;t absolutely need for launch. You can always build that stuff later when you have more information. It&apos;s best to just get it out there!</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><ul><li>05:06 - <a href='https://www.hey.com/features/the-screener/'>The Screener</a></li><li>07:22 - <a href='https://www.hey.com/world/'>HEY World</a></li></ul>
