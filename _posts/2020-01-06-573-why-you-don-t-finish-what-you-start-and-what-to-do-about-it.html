<p>How well did you do in completing projects last year? Not just work projects, but also personal projects surrounding family, fitness, or hobbies. If you didn't accomplish as much as you'd like, then maybe you need to change up your mindset and tactics in the new year.  </p>
<p>My guest today has written a guide to making those changes. His name is Charlie Gilkey and he's a former Army officer with a PhD in philosophy who's spent over a decade studying productivity, writing about it on his website <a href="http://productiveflourishing.com/">Productive Flourishing</a>, and coaching clients in what he's learned. He now has a book out as well: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SL9YNGD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07SL9YNGD&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Start Finishing: How to Go From Idea to Done</em></a>. Charlie and I begin our conversation going through the most common roadblocks that prevent people from completing their projects, including following other people's priorities and dealing with what he calls "head trash." We then discuss how we waste a lot of time doing what Charlie calls "thrashing' and what we can do to overcome it. We then dig into why you sometimes have to quit things to move forward, how to create effective goals, and why it's crucial to know which of three levels of success you're aiming for. We also talk about how to do what Charlie calls "momentum planning" and the importance of creating focus blocks in your schedule. </p>
