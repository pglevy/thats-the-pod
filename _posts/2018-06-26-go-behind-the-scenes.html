<p>A famous guy once said, &quot;Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!&quot; But he was a grifter. In fact, going behind the scenes—whether it&apos;s a factory tour or cooking show—can be a valuable experience for both visitors and guides. In this episode, we crash a middle school field trip to the Method soap factory on Chicago&apos;s South Side.
