<p>Have you ever noticed the guy in a fighting stance on the Art of Manliness logo? That’s not just some random symbol; it’s an actual dude: John L. Sullivan, the greatest bare-knuckle boxer of the 19th century.</p><p>While most people think bare-knuckle boxing came to an end during Sullivan’s era, in fact, it never entirely went away. In his new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3UfHIvW"><i>Bare Knuckle: Bobby Gunn, 73–0 Undefeated. A Dad. A Dream. A Fight Like You’ve Never Seen</i></a>, Stayton Bonner charts bare-knuckle boxing’s rise, fall, and resurgence, as well as the improbable story of its modern chapter’s winningest champion. Today on the show, Stayton describes bare-knuckle boxing’s incredible popularity a century ago, and why gloved boxing took its place while bare-knuckle got pushed into a shadowy, illicit underground. Stayton takes us into that secret circuit which still exists today, revealing the dark, sweaty basements and bars where modern bare-knuckle fights take place and the ancient code of honor that structures them. And Stayton introduces us to a dominant figure in that world, Bobby Gunn, an undefeated bare-knuckle fighter who combines a love of faith, family, and fighting and has helped turn bare-knuckle boxing into what is now the world’s fastest-growing combat sport.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/manly-honor-part-i-what-is-honor/" target="_blank">AoM series on honor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/military/the-gentlemen-the-roughs-dr-lorien-foote/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #41: Honor in the Civil War — The Gentlemen & The Roughs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/art-of-manliness-podcast-54-the-life-of-john-l-sullivan-with-christopher-klein/">Podcast #54: The Life of John L.
