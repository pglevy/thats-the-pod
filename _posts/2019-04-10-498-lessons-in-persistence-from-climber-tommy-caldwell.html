<p>On El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, there was a wall that had never been climbed, and that some said would never be climbed. It’s called the Dawn Wall.</p><p>But in 2015, <a href="http://tommycaldwell.com" target="_blank">Tommy Caldwell</a> along with Kevin Jorgeson became the first to free climb it. That journey was then made into an award-winning film called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K6ZG7P2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07K6ZG7P2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Dawn Wall</em></a>. </p><p>Today I speak to Tommy about what led up to that historic climb, starting from how he got involved in rock climbing in his childhood. We begin our conversation discussing the different types of rock climbing and why people often misinterpret what "free climbing" means. We then dig into Tommy’s climbing career, including his early success in sport climbing and the harrowing experience of being held hostage by and escaping from rebels in Kyrgyzstan. We then discuss how Tommy responded to losing a finger and getting divorced, and why he decided to climb the Dawn Wall. We end our conversation discussing the years-long process of preparing for the climb and the virtue of what Tommy calls “elective suffering.” </p><p>There are a lot of little, potent lessons here in how to remain persistent and driven in the face of setbacks that apply beyond climbing to every aspect of life.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/dawnwall" target="_blank">aom.is/dawnwall</a>.</p>
