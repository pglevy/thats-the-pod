<p>If you hate paying taxes, then you should love learning about taxes because that’s the way to reduce them. My guest, Kaye Thomas, received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1980 and then began his career as a tax attorney, dealing with complex tax matters related to business transactions, finance, and compensation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kaye now spends his time as a writer, publisher, public speaker, and consultant on topics relating to taxation and investments. He has written several books, including Capital Gains…Minimum Taxes, Go Roth! A guide to the Roth IRA and other Roth accounts, and Consider Your Options, a plain language guide to company stock and stock option compensation plans. His website, <a href='https://fairmark.com/'>Fairmark.com</a>, provides free plain-language guidance on the taxation of investments, taxes in retirement, kids and taxes, taxes on stock-based compensation, and much more.</p>
<p> </p>
