Here’s to the next 500 - onward and upward!</p><p> </p><p>Dave Rubin is the host of The Rubin Report, a top-ranking talk show with over one billion views and millions of subscribers. The Rubin Report is recognized as one of the most influential spaces for uncensored conversations about politics, culture, comedy, current events, and more. Rubin began his career in New York City as a stand-up comedian. He continues to perform throughout the United States and Europe utilizing his voice to illuminate the absurdities of the culture’s polarized political landscape. He accompanied Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on an international speaking tour where they addressed hundreds of thousands of people across three continents.
