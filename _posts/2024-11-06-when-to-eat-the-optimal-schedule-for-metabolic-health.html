<p>When it comes to weight management and all-around good metabolic health, we most often think about <i>what</i> to eat. But my guest would say that it's also crucial to think about<i> when</i> to eat,</p><p>Emily Manoogian is a chronobiologist and clinical researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Today on the show, Emily shares how to create an optimal schedule for a healthy metabolism by aligning your eating schedule with your circadian rhythm. She explains when to start eating after waking, when to stop eating before bed, the importance of sticking to a set schedule, and what happens to your metabolism when you don't follow these timing guidelines. We also talk about how to best distribute your calorie intake throughout the day and how to eat to mitigate the metabolic problems that come with being a shift worker.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.salk.edu/" target="_blank">The Salk Institute</a></li><li><a href="https://www.mycircadianclock.org/" target="_blank">My Circadian Clock app</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-1016-unlock-better-sleep-and-health-by-harnessing-your-circadian-rhythm/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #1,016: Unlock Better Sleep and Health by Harnessing Your Circadian Rhythm</a></li></ul><h2>Connect with Emily Manoogian</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilymanoogian" target="_blank">Emily on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/emilymanoogian?lang=en" target="_blank">Emily on X</a></li></ul>
