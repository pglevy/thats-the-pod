<p>Our guest on the podcast is Jerome Clark. He is the portfolio manager of the asset-allocation target-date strategies and oversees the college savings plan portfolios in T. Rowe Price's multi-asset division. He's also a member of the firm's asset-allocation committee and serves on the multi-asset steering committee. Clark joined T. Rowe's fixed-income division in 1992 as a portfolio manager of the firm's U.S. Treasury Long Term Bond strategy. He began managing multi-asset portfolios in 2001. Before joining T. Rowe Price, Clark was a captain in the United States Marine Corps and a mathematics instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy. He earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the U.S. Naval Academy, his master's in operations research from the Naval Postgraduate School, and his Master of Business Administration from Johns Hopkins University. Clark is also a CFA charterholder. </p></p><p><p>For his accomplishments during his tenure, Morningstar analysts recently named Clark the winner of the Outstanding Manager Award at the 2020 Morningstar Awards for Investing Excellence. He's slated to step down from his current role in early 2021.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.troweprice.com/financial-intermediary/us/en/search.html/biokey/2eb11f16-9b81-4170-8587-9253e6c32349" target="_blank">Jerome Clark bio</a> </p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/988663/winners-of-the-2020-morningstar-awards-for-investing-excellence">Winners of the 2020 Morningstar Awards for Investing Excellence</a>,"  by Sarah Bush, June 22, 2020. </p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/988943/meet-the-us-winners-of-our-awards-for-investing-excellence">Meet the U.S. Winners of Our Awards for Investing Excellence</a>," by Christine Benz and Sarah Bush, Morningstar.com, June 22, 2020. </p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/now-ubiquitous-target-date-funds-are-set-to-get-more-specialized-2020-07-07" target="_blank">Pioneer of Target-Date Funds Looks to the Future: Hedging and 'Tail-Risk' Strategies</a>," by Howard Gold, MarketWatch, July 16, 2020. </p></p><p><p><strong>Target-Date Funds</strong><br /></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_date_fund" target="_blank">Target-date fund</a> </p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liabilitymatching.asp" target="_blank">Liability matching</a> </p></p><p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Protection_Act_of_2006" target="_blank">Pension Protection Act of 2006</a></p></p><p><p>"<a href="https://www.troweprice.com/content/dam/fai/Collections/DC%20Resources/Pension%20Protection%20Act/PPA%20Anniversary%20Roundtable_May%202016.pdf" target="_blank">The Pension Protection Act's Impact on Defined-Contribution Plans</a>," T.
