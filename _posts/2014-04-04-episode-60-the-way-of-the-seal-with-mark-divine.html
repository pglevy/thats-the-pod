<p>In this episode I talk to Mark Divine, owner of SEALFit and the author of the new book, The Way of the SEAL: Think Like an Elite Warrior to Lead and Succeed. Mark and I discuss his service as as SEAL, how he's helped potential SEALs get ready for BUD/S, as well as how civilians can apply the principles that SEALs call upon to forge mental toughness.</p>
