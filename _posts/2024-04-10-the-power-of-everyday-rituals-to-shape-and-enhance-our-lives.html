<p>When we think of rituals, we tend to think of big, inherited, more occasional religious or cultural ceremonies like church services, holidays, weddings, and funerals. But as my guest observes, we also engage in small, self-made, everyday rituals that help us turn life's more mundane moments into more meaningful ones.</p><p>In the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ua9L0V"><i>The Ritual Effect: From Habit to Ritual, Harness the Surprising Power of Everyday Actions</i></a>, psychologist and Harvard Business School professor Michael Norton explores the way our DIY rituals shape, and enhance, our lives. We take up that survey on today's show. Michael explains the difference between a habit and a ritual and how individuals and families create unique "ritual signatures" even within more standard rituals like holidays. We discuss the different areas of life in which rituals show up and what they do for us, including how they help us cope with uncertainty, savor life, and connect to the past. We get into the function DIY rituals perform in romantic relationships, from deepening intimacy to facilitating a break-up, the role that "kinkeepers" play in keeping a family together, the tricky business of combining family traditions when people get married, how to know when a family tradition should be retired, and much more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/the-rites-of-manhood-mans-need-for-ritual/" target="_blank">AoM series on the power of ritual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/how-to-turn-an-ordinary-routine-into-a-spirit-renewing-ritual/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Turn an Ordinary Routine Into a Spirit-Renewing Ritual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/mens-rituals-rites-of-passage/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #505: A Man’s Need for Ritual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-835-the-power-of-ritual/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #835: The Power of Ritual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cii6ruuycQA" target="_blank">"Deja Vu" by Olivia Rodrigo</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Michael Norton</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://michaelnorton.com/" target="_blank">Michael's website</a> — including <a href="https://michaelnorton.com/rituals-quiz/" target="_blank">the "Habit or Ritual?" quiz</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/04/ritual_effect.jpg" alt="" />
