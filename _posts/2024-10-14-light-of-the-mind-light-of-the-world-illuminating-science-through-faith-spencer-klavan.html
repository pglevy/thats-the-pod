<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, lecturer, and podcaster Spencer Klavan. They discuss the fruits and follies of the postmodern worldview, how our conscious and subconscious rank order data and form perceptions, where disparate creation myths and biblical depictions overlap, why God does not rule by force, and how just about everything we uncover through science reaffirms the notion of an underlying unity</p><p> </p><p>Spencer A. Klavan is host of the Young Heretics podcast and associate editor of The Claremont Review of Books. A graduate of Yale, he earned his doctorate in ancient Greek literature from Oxford University. He is the author, most recently, of the acclaimed book Light of the Mind, Light of the World: Illuminating Science Through Faith, as well as the editor of Gateway to the Stoics and Gateway to the Epicureans.
