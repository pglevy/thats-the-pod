<p>In 18th century America, this book was second in popularity only to the Bible.</p><p>It was a favorite of many thinkers and leaders throughout history, including Emerson, Napoleon, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, and even President Truman.</p><p>Yet, you probably haven't read it.</p><p>It's Plutarch's <a href="https://amzn.to/40quAJ3"><i>Parallel Lives</i></a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>, you're in for a treat, as today's episode offers a great intro. My guest, Alex Petkas, found that even though he's a former classicist and professor, Plutarch's Lives is still a tough read, which is why he started a podcast, <i>The Cost of Glory</i>, to make it more accessible to people. He does the same thing on today's episode, sharing the background on Plutarch's set of biographies and its major themes. Alex explains why Plutarch thought that biography was a powerful way to transmit morals and how the Homeric virtue he had in mind differed from that of just having good, upstanding character. Alex then gives us a taste of Plutarch as we discuss the lives of two obscure Greek and Roman figures. We end our conversation with how to get started studying Plutarch yourself.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://costofglory.com/" target="_blank"><i>Cost of Glory</i> website</a></li><li><a href="https://costofglory.com/how-to-read-all-of-plutarchs-lives/" target="_blank">Alex's resource on how to read Plutarch's <i>Lives,</i> with links to the mentioned Penguin editions</a></li><li>Alex's recommended episodes of the <i>Cost of Glory</i> podcast:<ul><li><a href="https://costofglory.com/episode/83-pompey-i-kid-butcher/" target="_blank">Pompey I: Kid Butcher</a></li><li><a href="https://costofglory.com/episode/71-crassus-1-richest-man-in-rome/" target="_blank">Crassus I: Richest Man in Rome</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/what-is-envy/" target="_blank">AoM Article: An Intro to Envy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/envy-ressentiment-and-the-inversion-of-values/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Envy, Ressentiment, and the Inversion of Values</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-949-unpacking-the-emotion-no-one-likes-to-talk-about/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #949: Unpacking The Emotion No One Likes to Talk About</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla" target="_blank">Sulla</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes" target="_blank">Eumenes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Sertorius" target="_blank">Sertorius</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4eWJTOb" target="_blank"><i>Blood and Thunder: The Epic Story of Kit Carson and the Conquest of the American West</i> by Hampton Sides</a> + <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-681-the-epic-exploits-of-kit-carson/" target="_blank">AoM podcast episode about the book</a></li></ul><h2>Connect with Alex Petkas</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-petkas-50836b33" target="_blank">Alex on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/costofglory" target="_blank">Alex on X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexpetkas/" target="_blank">Alex on IG</a></li></ul>
