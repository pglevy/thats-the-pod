He would refuse to understand. He would threaten you, would cajole you, bribe you or charm you. He would do whatever he had to do, but he would get that vote.</p><p>[9:00] What mattered to him was winning because he knew what losing could be. What its consequences could be.</p><p>[9:50] Robert Caro books I've read: </p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/45OoGlp">The Power Broker </a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/43t5WFW">The Path to Power</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/45yEsk6">Means of Ascent</a></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3N3CAJ0">Master of The Senate</a> (currently reading) </p><p>[11:00] about what I wanted to do with my life and my books (which <i>are</i> my life)</p><p>[11:40] I am a reflection of what I do. — Steve Jobs</p><p>[23:20] There are certain moments in your life when you suddenly understand something about yourself. I loved going through those files, making them yield up their secrets to me.</p><p>[24:10] Turn every page. Never assume anything. Turn every goddamn page.</p><p>[27:50] Robert Caro snaps: No, that's not why highways get built where they get built. They get built there <i>because Robert Moses wants them there</i>.</p><p>[28:15] Robert Moses had power that no one understood. Power that nobody else was even thinking about.</p><p>[29:50] There are sentences that are said to you in your life that are chiseled into your memory.</p><p>[34:00] Three of the editors took me to some fancy restaurant and told me they could make me a star. Bob Gottlieb said, Well, I don't go out for lunch but we can have a sandwich at my desk and talk about your book. So of course I picked him.</p><p>[37:15] Robert Moses was a ruthless genius with savage energy.</p><p>[38:30] <i><strong>Ambitious people are rare</strong>, so if everyone is mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives, then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers. <strong>When you take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like dying plants given water.</strong> Probably <strong>most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd get from ambitious peers</strong>, whatever their age.</i></p><p><i>— </i><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham’s essays</a>.

Something on the way to work had excited him and thrilled him so much that he'd break into a run every morning.</p><p>[56:15] And as Lyndon Johnson came up Capitol Hill in the morning, he would be running.</p><p><strong>Well, of course he was running—from the land of poverty to this. Everything he had ever wanted, everything he had ever hoped for, was there</strong>.</p><p>----</p><p>Join my free email newsletter to <a href="https://world.hey.com/davidsenra/buffett-and-munger-a-study-in-simplicity-and-uncommon-common-sense-6ae80a40">get my top 10 highlights from every book</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
