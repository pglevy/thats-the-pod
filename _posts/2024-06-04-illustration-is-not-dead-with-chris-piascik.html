<p>Learn how to make better art! Take Composition for Illustrators on Skillshare — Use my link to get 30 days free! — <a href="https://skl.sh/3TLdkeh">https://skl.sh/3TLdkeh</a><br /><br />Today I chat with my friend Chris Piascik. Chris is an illustrator for clients like Nike, Nickelodeon and Google. He's also a YouTuber and a Top Teacher on Skillshare. We have a free-ranging, loosey goosey conversation about things like: Whether you need to go to art school to become an illustrator; Why Chris and I feel like we don’t quite fit into the “traditional illustrator” mould; We discuss whether the ability to draw realistically is necessary for illustrators today; We commiserate about angry dudes leaving nasty comments on our videos and — We start off with an unexpectedly long conversation about vector files (but as far as these kinds of conversations go, I think it was pretty interesting). </p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend.</strong></p><p>This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at </strong><a href="http://patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>http://patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a></p><ul><li>$8 Drawing Buddies gain exclusive access to my monthly Draw With Me meetups.</li><li>Join for as low as $3 to get 20% off my 1-on-1 coaching sessions</li></ul><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes!</strong></p><ul><li>Visit <a href="http://www.tomfroese.com/teaching">http://tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
