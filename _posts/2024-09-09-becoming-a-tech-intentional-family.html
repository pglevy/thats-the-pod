<p>In a family, a lot of the dynamics around devices and screens are reactive in nature. Kids bug for their own smartphones, parents worry they'll be left out without one, and without weighing the pros and cons, give in to their kids' requests. Parents let children have a ton of screen time because it lets the parents do what they want; then, they reach a moment where they feel disturbed about how much time their kids are on screens, berate their children for this habit, which they've facilitated, and vow that things are going to abruptly turn around.</p><p>Rather than basing your policies about kids and screens on mood, fear, and impulse, it would be better to do so based on reason and reflection. Emily Cherkin has some ideas on how to get there. Emily is a former teacher, a screentime consultant who helps parents and educators balance the role of devices in kids' lives, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZhR8v8"><i>The Screentime Solution: A Judgment-Free Guide to Becoming a Tech-Intentional Family</i></a>. Today on the show, Emily unpacks the state of screentime amongst kids today, how the "displacement hypothesis" explains how its impact extends beyond a decline in mental health, and why parents give their kids smartphones even when they're not sure it's good for them. We then turn to how families can become more tech intentional, and how that starts with parents taking a look at their own behavior. We discuss why putting parental controls on devices isn't the ultimate solution, why a better one is based on your relationship with your kids, why you need to live your digital life out loud, and some considerations to think through before getting your kid their first smartphone.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/podcast-300-raise-free-range-kids/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #300: How to Raise Free Range Kids With Lenore Skenazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/when-to-give-kid-smartphone/" target="_blank">AoM Article: What’s the Right Age to Get a Kid Their First Smartphone? 3 Tech Thinkers Weigh In</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/the-best-internet-filter-for-kids/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Best Internet Filter for Kids</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4e3FIze" target="_blank"><i>The Anxious Generation</i> by Jonathan Haidt</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/" target="_blank">The Light Phone</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Emily Cherkin</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://thescreentimeconsultant.com/about-emily" target="_blank">Emily's website</a></li></ul>
