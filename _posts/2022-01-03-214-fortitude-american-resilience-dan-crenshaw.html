<p>This episode was recorded on September 30, 2021.</p><p><br /></p><p>Congressman Dan Crenshaw and I discuss the fallout of withdrawing from Afghanistan and the details of the 20-plus-year conflict. We talk about life as a US congressman and his experience as a US Navy SEAL. About social media and politics–especially in relation to modern conservatism. And about climate change. On that note, we also examined Dan’s recently-published ”Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage.”</p><p><br /></p><p>Dan is a retired Navy SEAL with five deployments overseas during the Afghan and Iraq wars. While in Afghanistan, an IED blast led to Dan losing his right eye. Crenshaw was elected to Congress in 2018, where he serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee (broadest jurisdiction out of all legislative committees). Dan also serves on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. </p><p><br /></p><p>Find more Dan Crenshaw: @DanCrenshawTX</p><p>https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX</p><p><br /></p><p>Or on his website: https://crenshaw.house.gov/</p><p><br /></p><p>Check out "Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage":</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/Fortitude-American-Resilience-Era-Outrage/dp/1538733307</p><p> </p>
