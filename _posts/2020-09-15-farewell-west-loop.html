<p>Basecamp has closed its physical office after a 10-year run in Chicago&apos;s West Loop area. In this episode, we say good-bye to the neighborhood and two of its businesses. <a href='https://jpgraziano.com/'>J.P. Graziano</a> and <a href='https://www.eatuncooked.com/'>un-cooked</a> are small, family-owned restaurants on either side of the longevity spectrum: Jim Graziano is the fourth-generation owner of an Italian food importer-turned-sandwich shop, and Jeremy Jones opened his vegan grab-and-go place with his mother and wife in July. Jim and Jeremy talk about weathering the pandemic as independent restaurant owners.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p><a href='https://rework.fm/you-never-forget-george-pappageorge/'>Our previous episode</a> about closing the Chicago office - 00:21</p><p>J.P.
