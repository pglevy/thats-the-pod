<p>When you’re walking in the woods, you’re often surrounded by trees. But you probably don’t notice them much, and when you do spot some irregularity, like a strange bulge in the trunk of a tree, you likely don’t have any idea how it got there. But my guest says that these trees you’re passing by have all kinds of stories to share, and once you learn their language, they can tell you all sorts of secrets about the world, and even help you navigate it.</p><p>Tristan Gooley is an adventurer, expedition leader, natural navigator, and author of <a href="https://amzn.to/44kVWPl"><i>How to Read a Tree</i></a>. Today on the show, he unpacks the clues in a tree’s shape, branches, bark, roots, and leaves, what they can tell you about the environment, and how they can help you find your way. We also talk about what looking at a tree stump can reveal, the hidden seasons in trees, and the first place to look in a tree to spy fall foliage. We end our conversation with how to get started with reading trees today.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Tristan’s previous appearances on the AoM podcast:<ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-natural-navigation/" target="_blank">Episode #343: How to Read Nature — Awakening Your Senses to the Outdoors</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-563-how-to-develop-your-nature-instinct/" target="_blank">Episode #563: How to Develop Your Nature Instinct</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Tristan Gooley</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.naturalnavigator.com/" target="_blank">Tristan’s Website: The Natural Navigator</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/06/how-to-read-a-tree-2.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
