<p>I had the great privilege of writing the foreword to the 50th-anniversary version of the abridged version of one of the most important books of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, a devastating account of the absolute horror wreaked upon the people of the Soviet Empire by the acolytes of the doctrine of Karl Marx. I read the foreword here, in its entirety, and encourage everyone to purchase and study the book. It changed the world.</p><p>The 50th-anniversary version of The Gulag Archipelago is available at Amazon UK at https://amzn.to/2CQ8O6O or at multiple booksellers on the dedicated Penguin Random House page at</p><p> https://bit.ly/2Q2CUrb</p><p>NOTE: The North American license is held by Harper Collins, and the book is not available in its 50th-anniversary form except from the sellers above.</p><p>--</p><p>Additional relevant links re Solzhenitsyn:</p><p>Main webpage: <a href="http://www.solzhenitsyn.ru/main.php">http://www.solzhenitsyn.ru/main.php</a></p><p><br /></p><p> Nobel Prize acceptance speech: <a href="https://bit.ly/2SvkaSS">https://bit.ly/2SvkaSS</a></p><p>I have recommended many of Solzhenitsyn's books here: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/</p><p>- Thank you to our sponsors: <a href="https://allform.com/lp/jordan/podcasts">https://allform.com/lp/jordan/podcasts</a> For Advertising Inquiries, visit <a href="https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast">https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast</a></p><p> </p>
