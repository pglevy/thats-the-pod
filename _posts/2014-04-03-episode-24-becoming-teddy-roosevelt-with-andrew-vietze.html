<p>Welcome back to another episode of The Art of Manliness podcast! In this week's edition we talk to Andrew Vietze, author of the book Becoming Teddy Roosevelt: How a Maine Guide Inspired America's 26th President. Andrew's book focuses on a New Englander named Bill Sewell who served as TR's woods guide when Roosevelt was a young man. The relationship Sewell and Roosevelt formed had a profound impact on TR and may have even helped direct him to a career in politics. Through the biography of Bill Sewell, we get an intimate look at the formation of the TR's larger than life character.</p>
