<p>There are different philosophies one can have when it comes to money. Jared Dillian’s is built around eliminating as much anxiety around it as possible, so you hardly think about money at all.</p><p>Jared is a former trader for Lehman Brothers, the editor of The Daily Dirtnap, a market newsletter for investment professionals, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3UD0Rcs"><i>No Worries: How to Live a Stress-Free Financial Life</i></a>. Today on the show, Jared talks about the two biggest sources of financial stress — debt and risk — and how you can eliminate the stress they can cause. We discuss how three big financial decisions — buying a car, buying a house, and managing student loans — ultimately determine your financial health, and how to approach each of them in a stress-eliminating way. We also talk about how to minimize risk by creating what he calls an “awesome portfolio,” a mix of assets that has nearly the return of the stock market with half its risk. And Jared shares whether cryptocurrency fits into his “no worries” financial philosophy.</p><h2><strong>Resources Related to the Podcast</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/why-and-how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Why and How to Start an Emergency Fund</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/why-and-how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Start a Debt Reduction Plan</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/student-loans/" target="_blank">AoM Article: What Every Young Man Should Know About Student Loans</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/gear/how-to-buy-a-used-car/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Buy a Used Car</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/how-to/how-to-negotiate-the-best-deal-on-a-new-or-used-car/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Negotiate the Best Deal on a New or Used Car</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/ramit-sethi-interview-rich-life/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #536: How to Achieve a “Rich Life” With Your Finances</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/wealth/podcast-963-launch-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend/">AoM Podcast #963: Launch a Million-Dollar Business This Weekend</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Jared Dillian</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.jareddillianmoney.com/" target="_blank">Jared’s finance website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jareddillian.com/" target="_blank">Jared’s personal website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dailydirtnap" target="_blank">Jared on X</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/04/61EQlLB2iRL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Cover of the book "No Worries: How to Eliminate Financial Stress" by Jared Dillian, featuring a green background and minimalist graphic of a sinking ship." width="325" />
