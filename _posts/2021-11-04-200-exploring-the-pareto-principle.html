<p>In this episode, we investigate the principle set forth by Vilfredo Pareto (an Economist born in 1848) which specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. This principle serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced. The Pareto Principle is also known as the Pareto Rule, the 80/20 Rule, or the Matthew Principle. </p><p><br /></p><p>ï»¿Jordan often uses the principle to demonstrate the harsh reality that inequality is not a simple issue, and therefore has no simple answer.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sections:</p><p>[1:20] - 2017 Maps of Meaning 01 (Context and Background)</p><p>[10:45] - 2017 Personality 13 Existentialism via Solzhenitsyn and the Gulag</p><p>[17:01] - Biblical Series VIII The Phenomenology of the Divine</p><p>[21:34] - 12 Rules for Life Tour - Melbourne, Australia.</p><p><br /></p><p> </p>
