<p>What I learned from rereading <a href="https://amzn.to/3FJfKQr">Estée Lauder: A Success Story</a> by Estée Lauder. </p><p>Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/xmYekD6-PZ8">Runnin' Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love</a> by Bill Gurley.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----<br /><br />[21:14] I sometimes wonder if I had set my heart on selling tassels, cars, furniture, or anything else but beauty, would I have risen to the top of a profession? Somehow I doubt it. I believed in my product. I loved my product.</p><p>[32:07] Risk taking is the cornerstone of empires. No one ever became a success without taking chances.<br /><br />[39:24] I was single-minded in the pursuit of my dream.<br /><br />[44:38] Despite all the naysayers, there was never a single moment when I considered giving up. That was simply not a viable alternative.<br /><br />[55:59] We took the money we had planned to use on advertising and invested it instead in enough material to give away large quantities of our products.</p><p>[1:02:20] Never underestimate the value of an ally. Today they call it networking—this sharing between colleagues. It is one of the most powerful tools in the business.</p><p>[1:12:22] It's not enough to have the most wonderful product in the world. You must be able to sell it.<br /><br />[1:15:03] Love your career or else find another.</p><p>[1:19:05] Visualize. If in your mind's eye you see a successful venture, a deal made, a profit accomplished, it has a superb chance of actually happening. Projecting your mind into a successful situation is the most powerful means to achieve goals. If you spend time with pictures of failure in your mind, you will orchestrate failure. Countless times, before the event, I have pictured a heroic sale to a large department store every step of the  way and the picture in my mind became a reality. I've visualized success, then created the reality from the image. Great athletes, business people, inventors, and achievers from all walks of life seem to know this secret.<br /><br />[1:21:34] I've always believed that if you stick to a thought and carefully avoid distraction along the way, you can fulfill a dream. I kept my eye on the target. I've never allowed my eye to leave the particular target of the moment. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
