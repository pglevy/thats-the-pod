<p>Kelly Starrett, a doctor of physical therapy, has trained professional athletes, Olympians, and military special operators, helping them unlock peak performance. But as he approached his fifties, he started to see cracks appearing in the health of the folks around him. What had worked for his peers in their 20s and 30s, wasn’t working anymore; they were gaining weight, having surgeries, and just didn’t feel good.</p><p>So he and his wife and fellow trainer, Juliet, decided to write a book — <a href="https://amzn.to/3zy6M7i"><i>Built to Move: The Ten Essential Habits to Help You Move Freely and Live Fully</i></a> — that took all that they’ve learned from training elite performers and distilled it into the foundational practices that everyone, at every age, can use to develop lasting mobility, durability, and all-around health. Today on the show, Kelly unpacks some of those essential physical habits, sharing the “vital signs” — tests that will help you assess how you’re doing in that area — as well as daily practices that will help you strengthen and improve that capacity.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-213-undoing-the-damage-of-chronic-sitting/">Kelly’s previous appearance on the AoM podcast — Episode #213: Undoing the Damage of Chronic Sitting</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/">AoM article on the Sitting-Rising Test</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/undo-the-damage-of-sitting/">AoM Article: 7 Simple Exercises That Undo the Damage of Sitting (including the Couch Stretch)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/trigger-point-release/">AoM article on foam rolling</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/the-benefits-of-hanging-for-strength-and-mobility/">AoM Article: The Benefits of Hanging for Strength and Mobility</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/balance-exercises/">AoM Article: 12 Balance Exercises You Can Do on a 2×4</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/importance-of-proper-breathing/">AoM Podcast #638: How Changing Your Breathing Can Change Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/physical-benchmarks-for-men/">AoM Podcast #678: Physical Benchmarks Every Man Should Meet, At Every Age</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3M7ir4H"><i>Muscles and Meridians: The Manipulation of Shape</i> by Phillip Beach</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgAOykAgV4">Video of Kelly demonstrating the Couch Stretch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH72ycz0NOo">Video of Kelly demonstrating the squat test</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0tSwyx0SsQ">Video of 90/90 sit/stretch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Im1dxrre8">Video of Chris Hinshaw demonstrating the Old Man Balance Test</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Gym-Total-Upper-Workout/dp/B001EJMS6K?crid=126IE062PX7PN&keywords=pull-up+bar&qid=1680291056&sprefix=pull-up+bar,aps,138&sr=8-5&linkCode=sl1&tag=stucosuccess-20&linkId=30af342176a8b9ad34775fad3f633eb1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Get yourself a pull-up bar</a></li><li><a href="https://www.roguefitness.com/slackblock">The SlackBlock</a></li><li><a href="https://thereadystate.com/blogs/how-to-fix-shoulder-pain/">Kelly’s article on fixing shoulder pain, including a video on the Shoulder Spin-Up</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Kelly Starrett</h2><ul><li><a href="https://thereadystate.com/">The Ready State website,</a> including the <a href="https://thereadystate.com/built-to-move"><i>Built to Move</i> book page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thereadystate/?hl=en">The Ready State on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/thereadystate">Kelly on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/04/68015741.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
