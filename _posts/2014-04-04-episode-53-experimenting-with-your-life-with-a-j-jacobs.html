<p>In today's episode I talk to A.J. Jacobs, editor at large at Esquire Magazine, writer of several best-sellers (including A Year of Living Biblically, and Drop Dead Healthy), and a self-proclaimed human guinea pig.  He's now a contributor to Upwave. A.J. and I discuss some of the crazy experiments he's done with his life, the comic hijinkes that ensued with them, and how they made him a better man.</p>
