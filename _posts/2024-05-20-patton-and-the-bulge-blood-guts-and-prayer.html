<p>General George S. Patton is known for his aggressive, action-oriented tactical brilliance.</p><p>His character was also marked by a lesser-known but equally fundamental mystic piety.</p><p>Those two qualities would come together in the lead up to and execution of Patton's greatest achievement during WWII: the relief of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.</p><p>Alex Kershaw tells this story in his new book <a href="https://amzn.to/3wwmMci"><i>Patton's Prayer: A True Story of Courage, Faith, and Victory in World War II</i></a>. Today on the show, Alex shares how, when the Third Army's advance into Germany was stalled by plane-grounding clouds and road-muddying rain, Patton commissioned a prayer for better weather that was distributed to a quarter million of his men, and how that prayer became even more urgent after the commencement of the Battle of the Bulge. We also talk about Patton's qualities as a leader and a man, including his reading habits, how he combined a profane assertiveness with a pious faith and a belief in reincarnation, and what happened to him as the war came to a close.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Alex’s previous appearances on the AoM Podcast:<ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/military/361-untold-story-wwiis-45th-infantry-division/" target="_blank">#361: The Untold Story of WWII’s 45th Infantry Division</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/military/d-day-75-year-anniversary/" target="_blank">#514: Remembering D-Day 75 Years Later</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/military/against-all-odds-kershaw-podcast/" target="_blank">#806: The Humble Heroics of Four of WWII’s Most Decorated Soldiers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/military/podcast-953-duty-honor-and-the-unlikely-heroes-who-helped-win-the-battle-of-the-bulge/" target="_blank">#953: Duty, Honor, and the Unlikely Heroes Who Helped Win the Battle of the Bulge</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/george-s-pattons-rules-on-being-an-officer-and-a-gentleman/" target="_blank">AoM Article: George S.
