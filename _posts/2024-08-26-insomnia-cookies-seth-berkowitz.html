<p>When Seth Berkowitz was in college, he was the cookie guy on campus. Heâ€™d grown frustrated that the only food he could get delivered late at night were standards like pizza or Chinese food. He had a sweet tooth, and he craved warm, homemade chocolate chip cookies. So he took matters into his own hands and started making and delivering cookies to students at his school. The operation soon went from a silly side hustle to a real business - and then an all-consuming struggle. But today, after decades of detours, long-shot decisions, and near-bankruptcies, Insomnia Cookies is now a $350 million dollar business.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Andrea Bruce with research help from Katherine Sypher. Our audio engineers were Robert Rodriguez and Maggie Luthar.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and sign up for Guy's free newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="http://guyraz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guyraz.com</a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>
