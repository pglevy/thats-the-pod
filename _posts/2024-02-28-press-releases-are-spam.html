<p>Kimberly sits down with Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson to discuss a chapter from <a href='https://basecamp.com/books/rework'><em>REWORK</em></a> titled “Press Releases Are Spam,” explaining why traditional press releases don&apos;t work well for their product launches. The conversation touches on the shift from formal press releases to direct-to-consumer approaches in today’s media scene. They touch upon the importance of hearing from authentic voices with skin in the game rather than relying on formulaic press releases. The founders also share insights on their personal involvement in marketing and the ups and downs of being engaged in the social media attention game.</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@37signals/podcasts'>Check out the full video episode on YouTube</a></p><p>Key Takeaways: </p><p>[0:40] - Press releases haven’t worked for 37signals</p><p>[6:59] - Awkward CEO making direct-to-consumer work sets a significant trend<br/>[9:05] - Press releases signal desperation; personal connections more effective<br/>[14:17] - Authenticity trumps marketing.<br/>[20:24] - Don&apos;t delegate your voice; maintain direct communication</p><p>[25:52] - Balancing the trade-offs of social media<br/>[27:15] - Discussing navigating the intensity of attention culture</p><p>Rework is a production of <a href='https://37signals.com/'>37signals</a>.
