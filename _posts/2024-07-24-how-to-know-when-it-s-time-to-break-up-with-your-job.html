<p>You have a relationship with family, with friends, with a romantic partner. You may not have thought about it this way, but you also have a relationship with your job — a quite serious one, in fact; after all, you spend a third of your life working.</p><p>Just like the relationship you have with your significant other, there are ups and downs with your relationship with your job. It can start out with exciting honeymoon feelings, but along the way, you can end up drifting apart from your job, lose interest in it, or not feel appreciated. And there can come a time when you start wondering if you and your job should part ways.</p><p>Here to help you figure out if you should break up with your job is Tessa West, a professor of psychology and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4cJHDbP"><i>Job Therapy: Finding Work That Works for You</i></a>. Tessa interviewed thousands of people who have recently switched jobs or undergone career changes and found that there are five forms that job dissatisfaction typically takes. Today on the show, Tessa shares those five job dissatisfaction profiles, and how to know when you need to try to move into a new role within your company, or move on altogether and even change careers.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-834-the-7-types-of-work-jerks-and-how-to-deal-with-them/" target="_blank">Tessa's previous appearance on the AoM podcast: Episode #834 — The 7 Types of Work Jerks (And How to Deal With Them)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/30-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-leaving-a-job/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 30+ Questions to Ask Yourself Before Leaving a Job</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/how-to-change-careers/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #578: Figuring Out If You Should Change Careers (And How to Do It)</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With TessaWest</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.tessawestauthor.com/" target="_blank">Tessa's website</a></li><li><a href="https://tessawestlab.com/" target="_blank">Tessa's research lab</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/07/813uKRKy5uL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
