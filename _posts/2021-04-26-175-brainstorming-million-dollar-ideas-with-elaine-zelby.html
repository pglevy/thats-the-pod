Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) are joined by Elaine Zelby (@ezelby) for this brainstorm. Elaine brings the heat with ideas for starting a Saas bundle company (Sam says this is easily a $10m business), creating the "adult manual", the SNOO for adults, subscription running shoes, and a bunch of alternative health business ideas. Not only do they bring ideas, but they also break down how to pull off these businesses.
