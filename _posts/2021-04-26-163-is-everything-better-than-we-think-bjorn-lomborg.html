We examine the claims made in his latest book False Alarm. Throughout the episode we touch on sustainable development goals, prioritizing problems for the world, achieving the highest return on investment, the apocalypse lens we apply to many global issues, making the poor richer, innovation, adaptation, selling and marketing solutions, and much more.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dr. Bjorn Lomborg is a Danish author and President of the think tank, Copenhagen Consensus Center. Bjorn champions a path to solving world problems through the use of economic research to determine where to spend our resources based on the return on investment and severity of the impending issue. Dr. Lomborgâ€™s more notable books include False Alarm and How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you to our sponsors -</p><p><a href="relieffactor.com">Relief Factor</a></p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjMlo663JzwAhWhPK0GHfwNArAYABACGgJwdg&ae=2&sig=AOD64_0tetTh96_pF-zcfBrLpN1vA2KFRQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjTxoW63JzwAhX-IjQIHaR2CQMQ0Qx6BAgDEAE">Ladder</a></p><p><br /></p><p>For advertising inquires please contact: sales@advertisecast.com</p><p> </p>
