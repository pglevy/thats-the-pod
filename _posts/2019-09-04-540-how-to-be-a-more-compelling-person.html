<p>We all know people who have a certain magnetism and charisma. What is it exactly that makes them so compelling?</p><p>My guest today explores that question in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142181021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142181021&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Compelling People: The Hidden Qualities That Make People Influential</em></a>, and primarily locates the answer in two such hidden qualities: strength and warmth. His name is Matthew Kohut and today on the show he explains why it is we find the combination of strength and warmth so attractive in others, and how we can cultivate these traits ourselves, including in the way we dress, carry ourselves, and talk. Matt then gives advice on how to display strength and warmth in different situations we might find ourselves in, from acing a job interview to managing a crisis at work. We end our conversation with that most perennial question of body language: what to do with your hands when you speak.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/compellingpeople" target="_blank">aom.is/compellingpeople</a>.</p>
