<p>No kid forgets getting his first bike, nor the surge of independence he felt the first time he pedaled away from his parents. And even as adults, the bike seems to give off a feeling of romance, of freedom, and, when you get going fast enough, even of flying.</p><p>The special allure of the bicycle can really be traced back to its simple yet elegant design, and my guest today will unpack the intriguing history of its creation. His name is Jody Rosen, and he’s the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3QP7bt1"><i>Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle</i></a>. Today on the show, Jody explains the origins of the bicycle’s design, including how it was an anachronism at its birth, may have been inspired by a volcanic eruption, and helped liberate mankind from dependence on draft animals for transportation and exploration. We also get into how the bicycle was associated with flight right from the start. Along the way, we discuss how cycling represents an uncanny fusion of man and machine and produces a set of one-of-a-kind pleasures.</p><p>This episode will make you want to mount your trusty bicycle steed and take a ride.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Drais" target="_blank">Karl Freiherr von Drais</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy_horse" target="_blank">Laufmaschine</a>, aka the velocipede, aka the dandy horse</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing" target="_blank">The penny-farthing or high wheel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/how-to-teach-a-kid-to-ride-a-bike/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to “Teach” a Kid to Ride a Bike (Without Having to Teach Them at All)</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Jody Rosen</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.jody-rosen.com/" target="_blank">Jody’s Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/08/91nZjesOQhL.jpeg" alt="" width="350" />
