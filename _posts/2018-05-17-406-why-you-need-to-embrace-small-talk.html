<p>If you’re like a lot of people, engaging in small talk can feel awkward and tedious. Consequently, you avoid it as much you can. But my guest today argues that if you want to get ahead both personally and professionally, you need to embrace these little exchanges. Her name is Debra Fine and she's the author of &quot;The Fine Art of Small Talk.&quot; <br />Today on the show, Debra explains why small talk is actually a big deal and isn’t just a waste of saliva. She then shares the biggest obstacles people have to engaging in small talk and the two mindset shifts you need to make to get over those obstacles.

Lots of actionable advice that can immediately improve your day-to-day life, so take notes.<br />Get the full show notes at aom.is/smalltalk.</p>
