<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and stars of “Duck Dynasty,” Willie and Korie Robertson, discuss faith and family values as they were presented in the show, how they were preserved behind-the-scenes, the balance between reality and fiction, structure and playful spontaneity that was captured on “Duck Dynasty,” and the true positive impact the show had on viewers, as well as the culture of America during and since its phenomenal 11-season run.</p><p> </p><p>Willie and Korie Robertson are the stars of A&E’s hit reality TV show “Duck Dynasty” and executive producers of “The Blind,” the true story of the Robertson family. Together, they grew their family business, Duck Commander, from a living room operation into a destination for all things outdoors. They also built Tread Lively, a multimedia production company that creates films, television shows, and award-winning podcasts that uplift the culture.</p><p> </p><p>The Robertsons' story is a remarkable example of entrepreneurship built on faith, family, and ducks, in that order. Married for 31 years, they live in West Monroe, Louisiana, with their large and growing family. Their writing credits include “The Duck Commander Family: How Faith, Family, and Ducks Built a Dynasty,” “American Hunter,” “American Entrepreneur,” and “Strong and Kind: Raising Kids of Character.” Willie and Korie are passionate about adoption, storytelling, and doing life with their kids and grand-babies.
