<p>The world of Norse mythology and legend is a thoroughly fascinating one, and my guest has captured it in all its compelling mystery in his book which retells those stories, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1681778467/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1681778467&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Tales of Valhalla</em></a>. His name is Martyn Whittock and today he takes us on a gripping tour of Norse culture and myth.</p><p>We begin the show discussing who the Norse people were, and the misconceptions people commonly have about them, including associating them exclusively with Vikings. We also talk about misconceptions about the Vikings themselves, and what it really meant to be a Viking. We then get into why it's hard to completely recapture Norse myths and rituals as they were originally known. Martyn then unfolds the Norse creation story, offers interesting snapshots of the major Norse gods, including Odin, Thor, and Loki, and explains what Ragnarok was all about. We end our conversation discussing Norse sagas, and how Norse culture continues to influence our modern culture today.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/norsemyths" target="_blank">aom.is/norsemyths</a>.</p>
