<p>My guest today is New York Times columnist David Brooks, who also authored the book &quot;The Road to Character.&quot;<br />David and I begin our discussion with the “crooked timber” view of humanity that people had in previous generations and how it shaped moral development. He then takes us through the cultural changes that got rid of this perspective of human nature and how that led to a loss of a moral vocabulary that makes it hard for people today to even talk about character.<br />We then take a look at the lives of several eminent individuals from history and what they can teach us about character formation. From General Eisenhower’s battle to harness his uncontrollable anger, to George Marshall’s inner fight for discipline and the ability to put big picture goals ahead of personal ambition.<br />We end our conversation talking about the mindsets and actions we can take to live a life of character.<br />This is an important, interesting, and edifying episode I hope you'll tune in for.</p>
