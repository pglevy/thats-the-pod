<p>Maybe you're in a midlife slump. Maybe you're unhappy in your job and marriage. Maybe you're inactive and overweight. Maybe you've tried to change your life before but can't seem to make the changes stick. What do you need to do to finally turn things around?</p><p>My guest would say that the answer might be getting a dog.</p><p>Jeff Goodrich is the author of <a href="https://www.diangelopublications.com/shop/p/dude-and-duder"><i>Dude and Duder: How My Dog Saved My Life</i></a>. Today on the show, Jeff shares what his life was like at age 49 before getting Duder the Dog, and how Duder sparked changes that helped him lose 70 pounds, repair his relationships, and find real happiness. Along the way, we talk about advice that can apply to anyone trying to get out of the midlife slump, even if you don't own a dog, although Jeff would say you really should get one.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-776-how-to-shift-out-of-the-midlife-malaise/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #776: How to Shift Out of the Midlife Malaise</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/choosing-mans-best-friend-a-guide-to-canine-companions/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Choosing Man’s Best Friend — A Guide to Canine Companions</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/why-a-man-should-get-his-dog-from-the-pound/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Why a Man Should Get His Dog From the Pound</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/solvitur-ambulando-it-is-solved-by-walking/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Solvitur Ambulando — It Is Solved By Walking</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Jeff Goodrich</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://dudeandduder.com/" target="_blank">The Dude and Duder website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dudeandduder/" target="_blank">Dude and Duder on IG</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/10/61AWFgDjL._SL1360_.jpg" alt="" /><h2> </h2>
