<p>Today on the podcast, we welcome back Jonathan Clements. Jonathan was one of our first guests when we launched this podcast, and today marks his third appearance. He’s the founder and editor of HumbleDollar, and he has written or edited several books about money and investing, including <i>My Money Journey</i> and <i>How to Think About Money</i>. Earlier in his career, Jonathan spent almost 20 years at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, where he was the newspaper’s personal finance columnist and six years at Citigroup, where he was director of financial education for the bank’s US Wealth Management arm. This past June, Jonathan shared his devastating recent cancer diagnosis, and he’s been writing candidly about the experience on HumbleDollar. We’ll link to those posts in the show notes. I wanted to conduct today’s interview solo because Jonathan’s work has been hugely influential to me personally, and he also wrote the foreword to my forthcoming book. I couldn’t be more grateful.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://humbledollar.com/about/jonathan-clements/">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://humbledollar.com/about/" target="_blank">HumbleDollar</a></p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/577861e2-3ff2-4e95-bcab-6c793dad8f00">Jonathan Clements: ‘It’s in Wall Street’s Interest to Make Everyday Investors Think That They Are Stupid,’</a>” <i>The Long View</i> podcast, Morningstar.com, July 31, 2019.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/21b9c9ea-ec70-43b9-9ca8-3e8f5b7dc0fe">Jonathan Clements: ‘Humility Is a Hallmark of People Who Are Financially Successful,’</a>” <i>The Long View</i> podcast, Morningstar.com, Dec. 26, 2023.</p><p><strong>Books</strong></p><p><a href="https://humbledollar.com/book/my-money-journey/" target="_blank"><i>My Money Journal: How 30 People Found Financial Freedom—And You Can Too</i></a></p><p><a href="https://humbledollar.com/book/from-here-to-financial-happiness/"><i>From Here to Financial Happiness: Enrich Your Life in Just 77 Days</i></a></p><p><a href="https://humbledollar.com/book/how-to-think-about-money/" target="_blank"><i>How to Think About Money</i></a></p><p><strong>Articles</strong></p><p>“<a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/10/turned-upside-down/" target="_blank">Turned Upside Down</a>,” by Jonathan Clements, humbledollar.com, Oct. 5, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/09/never-quite-enough/" target="_blank">Never Quite Enough</a>,” by Jonathan Clements, humbledollar.com, Sept. 21, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/28/thoughts-on-dying-stage-four-cancer/" target="_blank">Opinion: Living Was Easy.
