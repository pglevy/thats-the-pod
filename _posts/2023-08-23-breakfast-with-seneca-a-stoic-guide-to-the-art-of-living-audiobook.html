<p>Above is an audiobook excerpt from David Fideler’s <em>Breakfast with Seneca: A Stoic Guide to the Art of Living.</em><em> </em>Special thanks to W. W. Norton & Company and Tantor Media & HighBridge Audio. </p><p>In<em> Breakfast with Seneca</em>, philosopher David Fideler mines Seneca's classic works in a series of focused chapters, clearly explaining Seneca's ideas without oversimplifying them. Best enjoyed as a daily ritual, like an energizing cup of coffee, Seneca's wisdom provides us with a steady stream of time-tested advice about the human condition - which, as it turns out, hasn't changed much over the past 2,000 years.</p><p>The most companionable of the new Stoic books.</p><p>—Molly Young, New York Times</p><p>David Fideler is an esteemed guest speaker at our upcoming virtual event, <em>On Seneca: Anger, Fear, and Sadness</em> on Saturday, August 19th @ 12 pm EDT.
