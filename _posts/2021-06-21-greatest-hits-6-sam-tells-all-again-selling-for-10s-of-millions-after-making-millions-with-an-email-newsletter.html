On this episode, Sam (@theSamParr) gives an update on an earlier episode with one of our most popular guests, himself. Sam revisits what he said almost 2 years during Episode 3, and shares 18 updates on how he currently thinks about those same topics now.
Sam Parr (@theSamParr) is the founder of The Hustle - a simple email newsletter that has surpassed 1M daily subscribers and will be north of 8 figures this year. Sam walks us through how he built The Hustle from scratch as well as his adventures starting a hot dog stand, selling booze on the internet, meeting celebrities on the street and convincing them to hire him and how he would get rich if he was 21 again!
