<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2M09BZu">Alfred Nobel: A Biography</a> by Kenne Fant.</p><p>----</p><p>Come see a live show with me and Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Invest Like The Best on October 19th in New York City. </p><p><a href="https://www.axs.com/events/498660/founder-mentality-patrick-oyshaughnessy-david-senra-tickets?skin=websterhall">Get your tickets here</a>! </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://foundersdaily.supercast.com/">Subscribe to listen to Founders Premium</a>  </p><p>Subscribers can: </p><p>-ask me questions directly</p><p>-listen to Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes</p><p>-listen to every bonus episode</p><p>---</p><p>[16:24] The self-awareness that would become so characteristic of him was awakening and with it the determination to be the master of every situation. He was not going to throw himself into the world and let luck or chance lead the way. </p><p>[26:26] When it comes to serious matters, I have adopted the rule of acting seriously. </p><p>[28:09] <strong>Alfred never forgot poverty</strong>. </p><p>[30:04] Financial pressure was accelerating his development as an inventor. </p><p>[39:15] Alfred asked her what she wished as a wedding present. The quick-witted young woman astonished him by replying without hesitation, “As much as Monsieur Nobel himself earns in one day.” Impressed and amused, Alfred agreed. The girl received a monetary gift of such size that she and her husband could enjoy it as long as their marriage lasted. The bank draft Alfred signed was for $110,000. </p><p>[47:33] It would take many years for Alfred to accept the idea that sometimes business failures were inevitable, that steps forward in one market were very often followed by a decline in another. Alfred learned to steel himself so that the disappointments would not depress him into inaction. </p><p>[51:18] <strong>Never do yourself what others could do better or equally well</strong>. </p><p>[57:26] <strong>Nobel had a soul of fire. He worked hard, burned with ideas, and spurred his collaborators on with his contagious energy</strong>. </p><p>[58:04] When he went somewhere he liked to get there fast. </p><p>[59:17] Whatever a human being manages to accomplish during his or her lifetime, there are so utterly few whose names will remain on the pages of history for any extended amount of time. Rarer still are those whose renown grows after their death. Alfred Nobel belongs among these. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://foundersdaily.supercast.com/">Subscribe to listen to Founders Premium</a> — Subscribers can ask me questions directly which I will answer in Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes </p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
