<p>In the modern age, shame is often seen as an unmitigated bad. According to this popular view, all shame is negative and toxic and steps should be taken to avoid and rid oneself of it. My guest today, however, makes the contrarian case that some shame is actually necessary to develop a true sense of self. </p><p>His name is <a href="http://www.josephburgo.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Burgo</a>, heâ€™s a clinical psychologist and the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250151309/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1250151309&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Shame: Free Yourself, Find Joy, and Build True Self-Esteem</em></a>. Today on the show Joseph and I discuss what exactly shame is, what it feels like, and the difference between toxic shame and productive shame. Joseph then walks us through the sources of shame and how childhood shame can mark us for life. We then discuss tactics we use to mask or avoid feelings of shame, how these masking behaviors can sometimes get in the way of us making progress in our lives, and more productive ways to engage with shame. Joseph then digs into the culture of online shaming and the dangers we face as a society when we shame men by pathologizing healthy masculine attributes like assertiveness, risk taking, and competitiveness. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/shame" target="_blank">aom.is/shame</a>.</p>
