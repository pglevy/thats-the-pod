<p>In this episode we talk to Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charles Duhigg about his book The Power of Habit. The Power of Habit was our book of the month in the AoM Book Club and it has served as inspiration for a post and a video on the site, so I was excited that I had the chance to talk to Duhigg about his book. During our conversation we discuss what science has revealed about habit formation and action steps we can take to change bad habits.</p>
