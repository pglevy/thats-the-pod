<p><i>Note: This is a rebroadcast.</i></p><p>Over the last year, my 12-year-old son has been doing one challenge every week as a rite of passage and chance to earn a special trip. Some of these challenges have involved reading a book in a week, and the most recent book we gave him to read was <i>How to Win Friends & Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie. His review? He said it was the best book he's read so far.</p><p>So a book written almost 90 years ago can still be a favorite of a kid in the 21st century. Talk about some staying power. </p><p>The advice in <i>How to Win Friends & Influence People</i>, and Dale Carnegie's other classic, <i>How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</i>, is timeless. But to help introduce it to a new audience, my guest, Joe Hart, has recently co-authored the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZItLbI"><i>Take Command</i></a>, which synthesizes, updates, and adds to the principles of Carnegie's two perennial bestsellers. Joe is the President and CEO of Dale Carnegie & Associates, which continues Carnegie's work in the present day, and we begin our conversation with some background on the guy who kicked off this work back in 1936. We then talk about what principles we can take from <i>How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</i> on developing a positive mindset. From there, we talk about the big overarching principle of <i>How to Win Friends & Influence People</i>, and how you can use it to improve your relationships. We end our conversation with advice on how to live life with more intentionality and meaning.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3WZQ5fi"><i>How to Win Friends & Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3QsUxRg"><i>How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</i> by Dale Carnegie</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en">The Dale Carnegie Website</a>, with links to the <a href="https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en/books/take-command-book"><i>Take Command</i> book page</a> and the <a href="https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en/courses/190?franchise_id=240">Dale Carnegie Course</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/the-8-best-vintage-self-improvement-books/">AoM Article: The 8 Best Vintage Self-Improvement Books</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-818-the-philosophy-of-self-improvement/">AoM Podcast #818: The Philosophy of Self-Improvement</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/leadership/pastor-craig-groeschel-interview/">AoM Podcast #457: Leadership Lessons With Craig Groeschel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/male-spirituality-richard-rohr/">AoM Podcast #527: The Journey to the Second Half of Life With Richard Rohr</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/david-brooks-second-mountain/">AoM Podcast #518: The Second Mountain With David Brooks</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Joe Hart</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/josephkhart" target="_blank">Joe on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephkhart" target="_blank">Joe on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/01/take-command-9781982190101_hr.jpg" alt="" />
