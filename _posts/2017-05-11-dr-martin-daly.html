<p>I'm speaking with Dr. Martin Daly, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, a pioneer in the field of evolutionary psychology, and author of Killing the Competition . Dr. Daly has determined that economic inequality and male on male homicide rates are strongly linked, and makes a causal argument for why this is the case, attributing it to status competition under stressful conditions. </p><p> </p>
