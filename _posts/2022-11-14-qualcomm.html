<p>Qualcomm, or “Quality Communications” — despite being one of the largest technology companies in the world, few people know the absolutely amazing technological and business history behind it. Seriously, this story is on par with Nvidia, TSMC and all the great semiconductor giants. Without this single fabless company based in San Diego, there’s almost no chance you’d be consuming this episode on whatever device you’re currently listening on — a fact that enables them to earn an incredible estimated $20 for every new phone sold in the world. We dive into this story live at the perfect venue: our first-ever European live show at Solana’s Breakpoint conference in beautiful Lisbon, Portugal! </p><p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!). </p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qualcomm-Equation-Fledgling-Telecom-Company/dp/0814408184/"> The Qualcomm Equation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Communication-Engineering-Jacobs-Wozencraft/dp/B075GX66QM/"> Principles of Communications Engineering by Irwin Jacobs and John Wozencraft</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Wb0sRhdwwdo1h4Ou7g9LEefZK1eGAADyL8V0eIfOGM/edit?usp=sharing"> Episode sources</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p><em>‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
