<p>According to my guest today, many of the world's most eminent leaders, thinkers, athletes, and artists have one thing in common: they cultivate stillness in their lives. </p><p>His name is <a href="http://ryanholiday.net/" target="_blank">Ryan Holiday</a> and in his latest book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525538585/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525538585&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Stillness Is the Key</em></a>, he highlights how great individuals have used stillness to do great things. We begin our discussion with how Ryan describes stillness, what it means to find stillness in mind, body, and soul, and how an individual can have stillness in one of these areas, but chaos in another. Ryan shares what we can learn about stillness of mind from JFK's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and how journaling and limiting media inputs can help us foster our own mental stillness. We then discuss the myth that relationships hold you back in life, and how they can in fact help you find both greater achievement, and stillness of soul. We also discuss what we can learn from Winston Churchill on how to find physical stillness, and why having hobbies is so important to finding balance in life. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/stillness" target="_blank">aom.is/stillness</a>. </p>
