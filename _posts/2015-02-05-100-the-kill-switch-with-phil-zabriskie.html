<p>What does it mean to kill for your country? How do you learn how to do it? What does it feel like in the moment? Once the killing starts, how do you control it? And what happens when you kill the wrong person, or donâ€™t kill someone you wish you had, or look back, years later, at the people you killed?<br />In this jarring and thought provoking book, journalist Phil Zabriskie interviews combat veterans the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and asks them what it's like to kill and what it has done to them and their families after they returned home.<br />It's an interesting discussion about something that hardly anyone talks about.</p>
