<p>We&apos;re taking off the month of August! During our hiatus, we&apos;ll be playing some vintage episodes of the 37signals Podcast, a show that Basecamp ran from 2009-2011 (and then forgot all about until Wailin came across the show during an unrelated Google search). In this episode, Basecamp (then 37signals) co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson answer questions from Signal v. Noise readers about the company&apos;s affiliate program, staying motivated, playing the stock market, and more.</p><p>We&apos;ll be back with new episodes of Rework next week!</p>
