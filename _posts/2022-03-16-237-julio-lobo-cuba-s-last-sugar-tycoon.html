<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/364VufN">The Sugar King of Havana: The Rise and Fall of Julio Lobo, Cuba's Last Tycoon</a> by John Paul Rathbone.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[2:02] <a href="https://amzn.to/3I6KsU2">Beyond Possible: One Man, Fourteen Peaks, and the Mountaineering Achievement of a Lifetime</a> (Founders #236)</p><p>[3:22] This is a cautionary tale.</p><p>[6:18] One of the main lessons of the book is just how fast things can change.</p><p>[6:25] <a href="https://amzn.to/3qaa7oI">The History of Cuba in 50 Events</a></p><p>[10:14] Lobo walked with a limp due to a murder attempt 14 years before that had blown a four inch chunk out of his skull.</p><p>[12:29] One of the most human of all desires is to perpetuate what you have created.</p><p>[12:55] Lobo thinks he has leverage when he really doesn’t.</p><p>[18:39] He dies in poverty. Imagine having $5 billion and then at the end of your life having to rely on an allowance from your adult daughters.</p><p>[20:30] I think about what Charlie Munger says: Don't try to be really smart. Just try to be consistently not dumb over a long period of time.</p><p>[20:58] <a href="https://amzn.to/3391dNg">Hershey: Milton S. Hershey's Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams</a> (Founders #146)</p><p>[22:59] Chico, I was born naked. I will probably die naked. And some of the happiest moments of my life happened when I was naked.</p><p>[29:01] From an early age it was apparent that Lobo sought not only wealth but glory too.</p><p>[30:21] He was an individualist who did not spare himself any sacrifice to attain his objectives.</p><p>[31:26] The clearest path to wealth is building a business that benefits somebody else's life. Make a product or service that makes somebody else's life better. Do that for a long period of time and keep improving it.</p><p>[33:45] His father told him I would much rather you make your mistakes now than later when I may not be around to pick up your pieces.</p><p>[38:16] It turns out that almost being executed makes you impatient for large success.</p><p>[40:32] If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it. —Warren Buffett from <a href="https://amzn.to/3FKJRqb">The Essays of Warren Buffett</a> (Founders #227)</p><p>[45:09] Think about the type of funeral you want. There is a story about a person who died. The minister said it is now time to say something nice about the deceased. After long time a person came up and said, “His brother was worse.” That is not the kind of funeral you want. —Charlie Munger</p><p>[50:34] <a href="https://amzn.to/2M09BZu">Alfred Nobel: A Biography</a> (Founders #163)</p><p>[52:30] <a href="https://amzn.to/3N8wR2D">The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America's Banana King</a>(Founders #37)</p><p>[54:26] They almost resorted to a duel, which was still common in Cuba at the time, where differences were often settled with machetes at dawn.</p><p>[1:04:34] There are times when chasing the things money can buy, one loses sight of the things which money can't buy and are usually free.</p><p>[1:05:10] <a href="https://amzn.to/3wFpJkC">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness</a> (Founders #191)</p><p>[1:05:17] A calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love, these things cannot be bought, they must be earned. —Naval Ravikant</p><p>[1:08:52] His business collapsed like a house of cards.</p><p>[1:09:34] It was the same ending that befell so many other famous speculators throughout history.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
