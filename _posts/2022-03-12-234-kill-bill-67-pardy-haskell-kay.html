<p>This episode was recorded on 03/09/2022</p><p><br /></p><p>Canadian Bill 67, which purports to be nothing but an "anti-racist" bill, is in fact the most pernicious and dangerous piece of legislation that any Canadian government has attempted to put forward. Dr. Peterson is joined by Barbara Kay, Bruce Pardy and Dr. David M. Haskell. This bill makes C-16 look like child’s play.</p><p><br /></p><p>Barbara Kay is a columnist for the Post Millennial, the Epoch Times, and Western Standard Online.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce Pardy is executive director of Rights Probe and professor of law at Queen’s University.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dr. David M. Haskell’s teaching and research focuses on religion in Canada, media in Canada, and religion and media in Canada. He is currently a professor at Wilfrid Laurier.</p><p> </p>
