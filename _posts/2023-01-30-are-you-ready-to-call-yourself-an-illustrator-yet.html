<p>Have you ever felt like a liar when calling yourself the thing you really want to be? Are you already doing the thing — illustration — but still find it hard to own the label — illustrator? In this episode, I share my experience of deep imposter syndrome, and I explain what I believe is the reason. If you struggle with feelings of self-doubt and unworthiness in your art or career, this episode is for you.</p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
