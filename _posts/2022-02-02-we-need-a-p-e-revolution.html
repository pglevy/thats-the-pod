<p>When it comes to physical education in our country’s schools, parents, teachers, and administrators alike typically place it at the bottom of their list of priorities — something to fit in if budget, time, and academic standards allow. My guest, however, says that P.E. should be thought of as the most important component in education, and as critical not only in ensuring the lifetime health of our kids, but even attaining those vaunted academic standards too.</p><p>His name is Dr. Daniel O’Neill and he’s an orthopedic surgeon, a sports psychologist, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/35yzs4i"><i>Survival of the Fit</i></a>. Today on the show, Dr. Dan lays out how a lack of physical activity is creating problems in kids from obesity to anxiety, and preventing the development of what he calls a “physical identity.” He explains the way the huge number of kids who don’t see themselves as athletes end up not pursuing physical activity at all, and why he thinks school-sponsored sports are only contributing to this problem. Dan takes us back to a time in our history when physical education was prioritized, and we discuss what’s wrong with modern P.E. and how it can be improved. Dan makes an argument for why P.E. should be the main, foundational thing focused on in schools today, and what people can do to push to make that happen.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/podcast-749-let-the-children-play/">AoM Podcast #749: Let the Children Play</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3KSmG0G"><i>The Motivation Factor</i> — documentary on the La Sierra P.E. program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-183-when-high-school-pe-was-a-man-maker/">AoM Podcast #183 on the La Sierra P.E. program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/jfk-on-the-dangers-of-americans-getting-soft/">JFK on Americans getting soft and the need for a more physically fit nation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.movnat.com/">Natural Movement (MovNat)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-508-break-out-of-your-cage-and-stop-being-a-human-zoo-animal/">AoM Podcast with Erwan LeCorre, founder of MovNat</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V81cO8xyMaI">Tedx talk on the Naperville, IL physical education program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-599-the-physical-intelligence-that-helps-you-take-action/">AoM Podcast #599 on “physical intelligence”</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/how-to-instill-a-love-of-fitness-in-your-kids/">AoM Article: How to Instill a Love of Fitness in Your Kids</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Dr. Daniel O’Neill</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://survivalofthefit.net/">Survival of the Fit Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/02/71NnY19iJL.jpeg" alt="" width="350" />
