<p>For this episode, we’re presenting Dr. Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life Tour lecture at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, WA on June 21, 2018. The lecture covers the evolution of religion thinking, a true human universal. Everyone has to deal with the problem of value. Everyone has to determine what is of more or less importance what’s a priority, and what is not or they can’t act, or even perceive. </p><p> </p>
