<p>How does the way men experience spirituality differ from the way women engage it? What obstacles particularly keep men from experiencing greater meaning in their lives, and what paradigm shifts help them find it?</p><p>My guest today has been thinking about those questions over the six decades he's served as a Franciscan friar. His name is <a href="https://cac.org/" target="_blank">Richard Rohr</a>, and he's authored numerous books and devoted a significant part of his vocation to working with men -- both ministering to those who are incarcerated, and in leading male initiation rituals and retreats.</p><p>If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/david-brooks-second-mountain/" target="_blank">my discussion last month with David Brooks</a> about life's first and second mountain, you'll want to listen to this one. Father Rohr has long taught the same concept, arguing that life is divided into a first and second half. We begin our discussion by exploring the difference between these two halves, and what it takes to move to the second half of life, including embracing non-dualistic thinking. We also talk about what prevents men from maturing into the second half of life, including having "father wounds." We then discuss how male spirituality differs from female spirituality, why church doesn't appeal to men, the male need for initiation, and what it means to do shadow work. We end our conversation with what fathers can do to help their sons embrace the spiritual side of life.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/rohr" target="_blank">aom.is/rohr</a>.</p>
