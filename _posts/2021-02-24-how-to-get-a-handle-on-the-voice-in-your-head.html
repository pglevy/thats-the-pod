<p>We all talk to ourselves all the time. This kind of inner dialogue can be a good thing, helping us focus and work through problems, but it can also go off the rails, turning into worry and negative rumination.</p>
<p>My guest today calls this negative self-talk "chatter," and in a book of the same name he outlines how to get a handle on it. His name is <a href="https://www.ethankross.com/">Ethan Kross</a>, he's a psychologist and the director of the <a href="http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu/">Emotion & Self Control Lab</a>, and we begin our conversation with the way introspection can be both good and bad, and the function of the voice in our heads. We discuss why negative emotions make us want to reach out to other people, and how this impulse can be harnessed in either a positive or detrimental way. We then unpack how managing the way we talk to ourselves really comes down to zooming out and getting distance from the self, and how this can be accomplished with a variety of tools, from engaging in a kind of time travel to going out into nature.</p>
