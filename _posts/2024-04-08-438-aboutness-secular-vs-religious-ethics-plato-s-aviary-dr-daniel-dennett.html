He has published dozens of books, such as “<i>Consciousness Explained"</i> (1992), “<i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life”</i> (1996), and “<i>Breaking the Spell: Religion as Natural Phenomena” </i>(2007).</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>2024 tour details can be found here https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  </p><p> </p><p>Peterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Daniel Dennett:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/danieldennett?lang=en</p><p> </p><p>The Problem with Counterfeit People (Article on AI, the Atlantic) https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/</p><p> </p><p>Consciousness Explained (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661</p><p> </p><p>I’ve Been Thinking (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Ive-Been-Thinking-Daniel-Dennett/dp/0393868052</p><p> </p><p>Breaking the Spell: Religion as Natural Phenomena (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Spell-Religion-Natural-Phenomenon/dp/0143038338 </p>
