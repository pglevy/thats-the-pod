<p>When people think about survival and preparedness, they tend to think of dealing with an end-of-the-world kind of scenario. But lots of bad things can happen, and are more likely to happen, that fall short of the apocalypse. My guest can help you prepare for any worst case scenario, whether it’s the worst thing to happen to mankind or just the worst thing to happen to you this year. His name is Mike Glover, and he’s a former Green Beret, the founder of Fieldcraft Survival, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/43Jy3AF"><i>Prepared</i></a>.</p><p>Today on the show, Mike and I first talk about the softer skills of preparedness. We discuss how to create plans using military concepts like war gaming and the PACE methodology, build your tolerance to stress, and develop your situational awareness so you don’t freeze in a crisis or let one catch you by surprise. In the second half of our conversation, we discuss the harder skills of preparing for worst case scenarios. Mike outlines what capabilities every man should develop. He shares his own EDC and what he recommends you carry and wear on a day-to-day basis. We talk about how to stock your home and car for emergencies and more.</p><h2>Related Resources From AoM’s Extensive <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/">Survival and Preparedness Archives</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-820-escape-the-safety-trap/">Podcast #820: Escape the Safety Trap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/how-to-make-a-bug-out-bag-your-72-hour-emergency-evacuation-survival-kit/">How to Make a Bug Out Bag: Your 72-Hour Emergency Evacuation Survival Kit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/how-to-bug-in-what-you-need-to-know-to-survive-a-grid-down-disaster/">How to Bug-In: What You Need to Know to Survive a Grid-Down Disaster</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/gear/complete-guide-every-man-keep-car/">What Every Man Should Keep in His Car</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/gear/beginners-guide-to-edc/">A Beginner’s Guide to EDC</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-save-lives-like-an-army-medic-using-a-tourniquet-to-control-major-bleeding/">How to Use a Tourniquet to Control Major Bleeding</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/a-complete-guide-to-home-fire-prevention-and-safety/">A Complete Guide to Home Fire Prevention and Safety</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/how-to-develop-the-situational-awareness-of-jason-bourne/">How to Develop Situational Awareness</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/the-complete-guide-to-making-a-diy-first-aid-kit/">The Complete Guide to Making a DIY First Aid Kit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-610-who-lives-in-survival-situations-who-dies-and-why/">Podcast #610: Who Lives in Survival Situations, Who Dies, and Why</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/complete-guide-to-home-security/">A Complete Guide to Home Security</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Mike Glover</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mike.a.glover/">Mike on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://fieldcraftsurvival.com/">Fieldcraft Survival Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcj3FycZBXIPNj7QIBKTIDw">Fieldcraft Survival YouTube Channel</a></li><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fieldcraft-survival/id1187664795">Fieldcraft Survival Podcast</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/06/61MXM3ETMgL.jpg" alt="" width="350" /><h2>Listen to the Podcast!
