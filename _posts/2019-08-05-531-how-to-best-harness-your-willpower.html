<p>Many of our goals in life -- from losing weight to saving more money -- require willpower. But what is willpower anyway, why does it feel like it fails us so often, and what can we do to make better use of it</p><p>My guest today explores the answers to these questions in her book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ERIRZE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005ERIRZE&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It</em></a>. Her name is <a href="http://kellymcgonigal.com/" target="_blank">Kelly McGonigal</a>, and she's a psychology professor at Stanford. We begin our discussion discussing what exactly willpower is, how it can be described as an instinct, and what goes on in your brain when you utilize it. We also unpack the idea that there are really three different types of willpower: I won't power, I will power, and I want power, and how these powers can be increased. </p><p>We then spend the rest of our discussion digging into the limitations of willpower, so we can avoid putting ourselves in situations where it's likely to fail us. We talk about how shame, the people who surround us, and even, ironically, making progress with our goals, can all lead to the sapping or loosening of our willpower. We end our conversation with Kelly's best tips for getting the most out your willpower.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/willpower" target="_blank">aom.is/willpower</a>.</p>
