<p>Welcome back to the podcast! In this week's episode we talk to actor Rich Sommer who plays ad man Harry Crane on AMC's hit drama Mad Men. We discuss Mad Men's take on mid-century masculinity, how starring in the show has influenced Rich's perception of manliness, and of course, we talk the dapper style of the men at Sterling Cooper. Tune in!</p>
