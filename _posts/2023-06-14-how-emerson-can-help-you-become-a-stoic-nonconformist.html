<p>When we think about Stoic philosophers, we typically think about the thinkers of ancient Greece and Rome, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. But my guest, Mark Matousek, says there was an incredibly insightful Stoic philosopher who lived on the American continent in more modern times: Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p><p>Matousek is the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3ParKCd"><i>Lessons from an American Stoic: How Emerson Can Change Your Life</i></a>, and today on the show, he shares how Stoicism and Transcendentalism overlap and how you can use Emerson's Stoic philosophy to become a nonconformist. We discuss the lessons you can learn from Emerson on developing self-reliance, embracing the strengths of your weaknesses, trusting your own genius instead of imitating others, gaining confidence from nature, compensating for the difficulties of relationships through the joy of deeper connections, living with greater courage, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/triumphnationalism/cman/text8/selfreliance.pdf">Emerson's essay "Self-Reliance"</a></li><li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45472/i-sing-the-body-electric">"I Sing the Body Electric" by Walt Whitman</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/finding-true-north-guide-self-reliance/">AoM Article: A Man's Guide to Self-Reliance</a></li><li><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/living/reading/emersons-advice-read-greater-self-reliance/">AoM Article: Emerson’s Advice on How to Read for Greater Self-Reliance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/31-days-greater-self-reliance/">AoM Article: 31 Journaling Prompts for Building Greater Self-Reliance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-self-reliance-what-is-it/">AoM Podcast #384: What It Really Means to Be Self-Reliant</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-894-thoreau-on-making-a-living/">AoM Podcast #894: Thoreau on Making a Living</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/7-journaling-techniques-that-can-change-your-life/">AoM Podcast #861: 7 Journaling Techniques That Can Change Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/sunday-firesides-despise-not-the-thing-that-would-save-you/">Sunday Firesides: Despise Not the Thing That Would Save You</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/sunday-firesides-look-into-the-tomb/">Sunday Firesides: Look Into the Tomb</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Mark Matousek</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://markmatousek.com/" target="_blank">Mark's website</a></li><li><a href="https://theseekersforum.com/">The Seekers Forum</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/06/91ulTlFSBmL.jpg" alt="" />
