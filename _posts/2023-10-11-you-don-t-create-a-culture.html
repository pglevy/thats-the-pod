<p>Company culture is more than just a buzzword or a section in your employee handbook. </p><p><br/></p><p>It&apos;s not something you can just write down and expect to manifest. It creates itself organically, through the attitudes and actions of your team that define how you work and more importantly how you work together. </p><p><br/></p><p>Today, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the Co-founders of 37signals, sit down with host Kimberly Rhodes to share their perspective on the pivotal distinction between &apos;wanting&apos; the right culture and actively &apos;doing the work&apos; to foster a positive culture that truly reflects your values.  </p><p>Listen in as they share what they look for in character and contributions when hiring new members for the team and how they assess whether a person will enhance or detract from the company&apos;s culture and operations.</p><p><br/></p><p>And for those facing the tough question of whether their company culture ‘sucks’, they provide valuable insights into the hard choices, and uncomfortable conversations that drive meaningful culture change.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href='https://youtu.be/MwHK6oaxyrM'>Check out the full video episode on YouTube</a></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:00] - Kimberly kicks off the show, and a discussion focused on culture from the book <a href='https://basecamp.com/books/rework'><em>Rework</em></a>.</p><p>[00:37] - Your organization’s culture creates itself.
