<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with teacher, filmmaker, and YouTuber, Warren Smith. They discuss his unexpected virality after Elon Musk retweeted a video of him teaching critical thinking. They also walk through the aftermath, Warren’s run-ins and eventual firing by administrative bureaucrats, why asking permission to take on the unknown is not needed, and how the choice to live a safe life or accept an extraordinary adventure is ultimately yours to make.</p><p> </p><p>This episode was filmed on November 21st, 2024</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>| Links |</p><p> </p><p>For Warren Smith:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://x.com/WTSmith17</p><p> </p><p>On YouTube www.youtube.com/@SecretScholars</p><p> </p><p>On Patreon https://www.patreon.com/c/Secret_Scholars</p>
