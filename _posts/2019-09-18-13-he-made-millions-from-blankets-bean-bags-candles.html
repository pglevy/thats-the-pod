John Fiorentino (@johnhfio) wants you to relax. And so far, its' working. He sold over $15 million worth of his product Gravity Blanket and Moon Pod. He talks to us about being broke, crashing on friends couches - to inventing and marketing the most popular blanket since the Snuggie, raising over $5 million on Kickstarter * why he thinks Silicon Valley is wasting too much time talking about tactics rather than focusing on making great products.Â
