<p>Your relationship with your mother is likely the first and most foundational connection in your life. At its best, this bond can be a source of comfort, strength, and love that lasts a lifetime and changes in healthy, appropriate, and adaptive ways as you mature into adulthood.</p><p>But sometimes, the attachment between a mother and her son can become unhealthy, resulting in a phenomenon called mother-son enmeshment, in which a man can become a kind of surrogate husband to his mom.</p><p>Here to unpack this complex issue is Dr. Kenneth Adams. Ken is a clinical psychologist who has spent much of his career working with what he calls "mother-enmeshed men" and is the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4dZLP7I"><i>When He's Married to Mo</i></a>m. Today on the show, Ken unpacks the characteristics of mother-enmeshed men and how to know if you are one, and he explains what can happen in childhood that would cause a mother to enmesh with her son. We discuss the problems enmeshment can create in men's relationships and other areas of life and how it can lead to things like compulsive porn use. And we unpack what it means for a man to become independent and emancipate from his mother, how it's different from cutting her off, and what it looks like to have a healthy relationship with your mom.</p><h2>Connect with Ken Adams</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.overcomingenmeshment.com/" target="_blank">Overcoming Enmeshment websiteÂ </a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/08/61e0svHuvpL._SL1000_.jpg" alt="" />
