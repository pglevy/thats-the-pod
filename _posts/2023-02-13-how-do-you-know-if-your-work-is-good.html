<p>Thank you for  over 5,000+ listens and  another 5,000+ views on YouTube so far!</p><p>In today’s episode we'll look at why making "good" work isn't the best goal to have. We'll look at more helpful ways to judge whether our work is WORKING or not. This will help you become better at critiquing your own work, and being more objective about it. Also: what self-taught illustrators miss out on by not going to art school; why open briefs are a nightmare for me, and what happened when a hamburger restaurant asked me to make "some wall art" for them. </p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
