<p>It’s a(nother) new era for Nvidia.</p><p>We thought we’d closed the Acquired book on Nvidia back in April 2022. The story was all wrapped up: Jensen &amp; crew had set out on an amazing journey to accelerate the world’s computing workloads. Along the way they’d discovered a wondrous opportunity (machine learning powered social media feed recommendations). They forged incredible Power in the CUDA platform, and used it to triumph over seemingly insurmountable adversity — the stock market penalty-box.</p><p>But, it turned out that was only the precursor to an even wilder journey. Over the past 18 months Nvidia has weathered one of the steepest stock crashes in history ($500B+ market cap wiped away peak-to-trough!). And, it has of course also experienced an even more fantastical rise — becoming the platform that’s powering the emergence of perhaps a new form of intelligence itself… and in the process becoming a trillion-dollar company.</p><p>Today we tell another chapter in the amazing Nvidia saga: the dawn of the AI era.
