<p>Think about your habits, the things you do automatically without much thought — from brushing your teeth in the morning to scrolling social media before bed.</p><p>There’s a lot going on with these behaviors.</p><p>On one level, they’re just routines and actions wired into our brains through repetition. But there’s also more to it than that. Our habits shape who we are, influence our health and happiness, and determine much of our success in life. There’s a reason changing habits is one of the most powerful ways to transform ourselves.</p><p>Today on the show, Dr. Gina Cleo will help us understand the science of habit formation and how we can harness it to build better behaviors. Gina is a researcher with a PhD in habit change and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4gUqjCz"><i>The Habit Revolution: Simple Steps to Rewire Your Brain for Powerful Habit Change</i></a>. Gina and I discuss the three elements of the habit loop and how to hack them to develop good habits and break bad ones. Along the way, we talk about why micro-habits are so effective for creating lasting change, the differences between men and women when it comes to forming habits, how long it really takes for a habit to stick, and much more.</p><h2><strong>Resources Related to the Podcast</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/power-of-habits/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Unlocking the Science of Habits — How to Hack the Habit Loop</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/building-breaking-habits/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #470: A Proven System for Building and Breaking Habits</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/podcast-581-the-tiny-habits-that-change-everything/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #581: The Tiny Habits That Change Everything</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/disenchant-your-bad-habits/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Disenchant Your Bad Habits</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3BEh4Yh" target="_blank"><i>Self-Compassion </i>by Kristin Neff</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Gina Cleo</strong><br /> </h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.drginacleo.com/" target="_blank">Gina’s website</a></li></ul>
