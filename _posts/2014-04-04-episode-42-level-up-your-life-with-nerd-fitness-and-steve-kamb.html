<p>Welcome back to another episode of the Art of Manliness podcast!<br />In this edition we talk to the founder and owner of one of my favorite websites, Steve Kamb of Nerd Fitness. If you haven't been to Nerd Fitness yet, go check it out today. Steve writes incredibly useful and inspiring content on how to improve every aspect of your life (but in particular your health) and does it in a way that's fun, engaging, and approachable. He's taken fitness and turned it into a real-life video game. On his site you'll find workouts inspired by The Hobbit and the Konami Code and motivational pieces inspired by The Goonies and Iron Man.</p>
