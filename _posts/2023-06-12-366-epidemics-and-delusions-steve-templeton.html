<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Steve Templeton discuss his recent publication, “Fear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.” They break down the “discussed response” of the behavioral immune system, the pathogenic treatment of people during the COVID pandemic, the shift toward perceptual safety over common good, the programmatically induced fear that censors open discussion around these topics even now, and the impenetrability of those afraid, even when met with fundamental truths.</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Steve Templeton is the Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Indiana University School of Medicine Terre Haute, formerly CDC/NIOSH. Dr. Templeton is the author of the new publication, “Fear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.” The book examines pandemic responses, cultural and administrative, weighing historic examples against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Steve Templeton:</p><p> </p><p>Website https://www.stevetempletonauthor.com/</p><p> </p><p>Substack: stemplet74.substack.com</p><p> </p><p>Twitter: @stemplet74 https://twitter.com/stemplet74 </p>
