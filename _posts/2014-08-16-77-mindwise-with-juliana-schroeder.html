<p>I talk to Juliana Schroeder, PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business about our mind's evolved ability to read the minds of others. This mind reading ability of ours is what makes a lot of social interaction possible.  Her research with Nichols Epley has uncovered some fascinating insights on how status makes us dehumanize others, how making small talk makes us happier, and how men and women are different and the same when it comes to reading the minds of others.</p>
