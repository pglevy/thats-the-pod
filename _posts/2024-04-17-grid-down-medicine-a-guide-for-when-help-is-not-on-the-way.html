<p>If you read most first aid guides, the last step in treating someone who’s gotten injured or sick is always: get the victim to professional medical help.</p><p>But what if you found yourself in a situation where hospitals were overcrowded, inaccessible, or non-functional? What if you found yourself in a grid-down, long-term disaster, and you were the highest medical resource available?</p><p>Dr. Joe Alton is an expert in what would come after the step where most first aid guides leave off. He’s a retired surgeon and the co-author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3vVwDYC"><i>The Survival Medicine Handbook: The Essential Guide for When Help is NOT on the Way</i></a>. Today on the show, Joe argues that every family should have a medical asset and how to prepare to be a civilian medic. We discuss the different levels of first aid kits to consider creating, from an individual kit all the way up to a community field hospital. And we talk about the health-related skills you might need in a long-term grid-down disaster, from burying a dead body, to closing a wound with super glue, to making an improvised dental filling, to even protecting yourself from the radiation of nuclear fallout.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-save-lives-like-an-army-medic-using-a-tourniquet-to-control-major-bleeding/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Use a Tourniquet to Control Major Bleeding</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/the-complete-guide-to-making-a-diy-first-aid-kit/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Complete Guide to Making a DIY First Aid Kit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/how-to-suture-a-wound/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Suture a Wound</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/gear/complete-guide-every-man-keep-car/" target="_blank">AoM Article: What Every Man Should Keep in His Car</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/improvised-ways-to-close-a-wound/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Improvised Ways to Close a Wound</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-869-the-survival-myths-that-can-get-you-killed/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #869: The Survival Myths That Can Get You Killed With <i>Alone</i> Winner Jim Baird</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Joe Alton</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.doomandbloom.net/" target="_blank">Doom and Bloom website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC729rp0OuiDlQUtlmJJfsyg" target="_blank">Doom and Bloom on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/doomandbloom/" target="_blank">Doom and Bloom on FB</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/04/61F0Y7804HL._SL1250_.jpg" alt="Cover of "the survival medicine handbook," featuring a red first aid kit on a road under a stormy sky, by Joseph Alton MD and Amy Alton APRN." width="325" /><h2><br /> </h2>
