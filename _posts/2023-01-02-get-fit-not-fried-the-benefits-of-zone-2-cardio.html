<p>When most people work out, they jump right from a resting state called Zone 1 cardio to Zone 3 cardio. But in skipping over Zone 2 cardio altogether, they miss out on a significant range of benefits to their health, fitness, and overall well-being.</p><p>Here to unpack why you need to make the relatively easy yet hugely beneficial form of exercise that is Zone 2 cardio a big part of your life is Alex Viada, a hybrid athlete and coach. We spend the first twenty minutes of this conversation discussing the physiological science of what cardio zones are and what happens in the body as you move from one zone to the next. From there, we turn to the more accessible and practical elements of getting into Zone 2 cardio. Alex shares the easiest way to know if you're in Zone 2, and we discuss how it can improve heart health, metabolism, sleep, and weight loss, as well as enhance athletic performance, whether you're into endurance sports or powerlifting. We then get into the amount of Zone 2 cardio you should be getting each week and how to get it, including Alex's take on the ever-controversial elliptical machine.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/zone-2-training/" target="_blank">AoM Article: A Guide to the Biggest Thing Missing From Your Fitness Routine — Zone 2 Training</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/hybrid-athlete-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #777: Becoming a Hybrid Athlete</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/run-like-a-pro-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #787: Run Like a Pro (Even If You’re Slow)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/conditioning-what-it-is-and-how-to-develop-it/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Conditioning — What It Is and How to Develop It</a></li><li><a href="https://completehumanperformance.com/product/the-hybrid-athlete-e-book/" target="_blank"><i>The Hybrid Athlete </i>by Alex Viada</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Alex Viada</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex.viada/" target="_blank">Alex on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/completehumanperformance/" target="_blank">Complete Human Performance on IG</a></li></ul><h2> </h2>
