<p><strong>"An artwork is never finished, only abandoned." </strong>This is apparently a quote from Leonardo Da Vinci. If one of the greatest artists of all time had trouble knowing when his work was finished, then it's no wonder the rest of us do as well.</p>
<p>In this episode, I share some ideas on what it means to complete a work, how to know when you should call it done, and if that's not possible, how to responsibly abandon it. </p>
<p>At the end I share some important news about the future of the podcast.</p>
