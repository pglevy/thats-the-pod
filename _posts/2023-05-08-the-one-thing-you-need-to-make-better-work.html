<p>What’s your point? Sometimes it’s not so easy to say. We ramble. We doodle. We struggle to know exactly what we want to say and do in our art. But once we find it, everything seems to come together smoothly. So how do we find our point? In this episode, I talk about how the power of focus helps us get there, and how we find this focus in the first place. </p><p>Join my Mailing List at <a href="https://www.tomfroese.com/contact">https://www.tomfroese.com/contact</a></p><p>This is a continuation of my exploration of Composition, which we started in Episode 11. </p><p>While I promised a more straightforward set of ”breakthrough” composition tips, as I wrote this episode, I really got stuck in the weeds. What I ended up realizing is that composition is easier to show, visually, than to talk about. So I will have to save much of what I have to say here in my future Skillshare class on the topic.</p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
