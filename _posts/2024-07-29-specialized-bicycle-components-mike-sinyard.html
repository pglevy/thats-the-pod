<p>Mike Sinyard helped put mountain biking on the map. In the 1970’s, he founded Specialized Bicycle Components to do exactly what the name suggests: sell high-quality bike parts. He eventually decided to make his own models, becoming a pioneer in the industry by designing the first mass-produced mountain bikes. By the 1990’s, Specialized was pulling in tens of millions of dollars in revenue, and Mike brought in outside experts to help grow the business. That turned out to be a huge mistake; Mike spent the next few years recovering from bad business decisions, and recalibrating the company after near bankruptcy. Today, Specialized has regained its reputation as an industry leader, and does around $500 million in sales per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
