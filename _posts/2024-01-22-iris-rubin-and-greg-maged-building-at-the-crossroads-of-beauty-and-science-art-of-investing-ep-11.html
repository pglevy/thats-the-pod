Our teachers today are Iris Rubin and Greg Maged, co-founders of SEEN, the fast-growing good-for-your-skin hair care company creating a new category at the intersection of science, health, and beauty. This was an illuminating conversation with two people who had already accomplished so much in their lives and careers before embarking on an entirely new entrepreneurial path.
This class has a number of fascinating dimensions to it, including lessons on how to successfully execute an unexpected second act mid-career, a case study on how to operate with a very different playbook to most early-stage companies, and attracting a purpose-built shareholder base. It's an inspiring story that began with a simple yet profound insight that hair care is skin care. It has snowballed into a movement to serve the hundreds of millions who struggle with various skin issues, from eczema to acne to hair shedding and beyond. Please enjoy our class with Iris and Greg.
