<p>War is about many things: glory, violence, courage, destruction. But at its heart is death. Each side in a conflict tries to kill as many of the enemy as possible, while avoiding being killed themselves.</p>
<p>The way these deaths have played out over thousands of years of warfare has changed not simply based on the way martial technology has changed, but also on the way that the psychological and cultural pressures that have led societies and individual men to fight have changed. </p>
<p>My guest today, Michael Stephenson, is a military historian who explores these evolutions in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JHKSS2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006JHKSS2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>The Last Full Measure: How Soldiers Die in Battle</em></a>. Today Michael and I discuss the forces that led soldiers to their fate over the centuries, from advancements in weaponry to the expectations of social class. At the beginning of our conversation Michael discusses why he wanted to write this book, and the balance he had to walk in trying to describe the reality of death on the battlefield, without conveying those details in a sensationalistic or titillating manner. We then trace the history of death in war, beginning with its primitive beginnings and working our way to the modern day. Along the way we discuss how gunpowder changed the nature of warfare, the effect that distance has on how heroic a confrontation seems, why artillery is particularly terrifying, what motivates soldiers to fight, and much more.</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly enlightening and humane look at an oft glossed over aspect of the human experience.</p>
