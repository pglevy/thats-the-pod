Today’s teachers are Drue Tranquill and Joe Schmidt, two of our very best former students. You'll hear about Drue’s improbable run to becoming Super Bowl champion with the Kansas City Chiefs and get to know Joe, a former walk-on at Notre Dame turned team MVP who went on to become a venture capitalist at Excel and now Andreessen Horowitz. 
Stepping back, we're just in awe of the way Joe and Drue embrace life with a sense of joy that is so infectious to all those around them. We think this joyful attitude might actually be the key to their extraordinary success so early in their careers. In fact, reflecting on the conversation we had with them, the old proverb came to mind about the student becoming the master.
We think after listening, you'll agree that this is absolutely the case. Please enjoy our conversation with Joe Schmidt and Drue Tranquill.
