<p>When you think about people getting scammed, you probably think of the elderly getting conned out of money over the phone.</p><p>But my guest today says that Millennials are actually more likely to get scammed than senior citizens, and in fact, anybody of any age can get conned. He should know: he's a former con man himself. His name is <a href="http://abagnale.com" target="_blank">Frank Abagnale</a> and his early life in which he forged checks and assumed various identities, including that of an airline pilot and doctor, was made famous by the movie <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767905385/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0767905385&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Catch Me If You Can</em></a>. After he served time for his crimes, he dedicated the next 50 years of his life to helping the government and businesses fight fraud. His most recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525538968/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525538968&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Scam Me If You Can: Simple Strategies to Outsmart Today's Rip-off Artists</em></a>, aims to educate regular citizens about the most common scams out there and how to avoid them. Today on the show Frank gives us the inside dirt on a bunch of different modern cons, from romance scams to investment fraud to scams involving rental properties. He reveals the insidious ways that scammers have gotten more sophisticated with their cons, the red flags to look for when you're approached with one, and how to avoid getting duped. And he explains why he's never used a debit card.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/scam" target="_blank">aom.is/scam</a>. </p>
