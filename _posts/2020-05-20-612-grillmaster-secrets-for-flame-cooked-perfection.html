<p>It's almost summer and you know what that means: grilling season is upon us. To help ensure that you have your best grilling season ever, today I talk to <a href="https://www.mattrmoore.com/">Matt Moore</a>, AoM's resident food writer and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0358187265/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0358187265&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>Serial Griller: Grillmaster Secrets for Flame-Cooked Perfection</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing Matt's trips around the country to glean the best stories and tips from our nation's foremost grillmasters. We first unpack why the Maillard reaction is so important to creating delicious browned food, and how to ensure you get that effect when you grill. From there we dive into more of the secrets of better grilling, including the pros and cons of different types of fuels and grill types and the essential tools to have on hand when making flame-cooked grub. Matt then offers his surprising take on the best way to grill a burger and explains how to grill the perfect steak, cook chicken so it doesn't dry out, and fire up fish without it falling apart. We end our discussion with Matt's grilled, mouth-watering alternative to a traditional peach cobbler. </p>
