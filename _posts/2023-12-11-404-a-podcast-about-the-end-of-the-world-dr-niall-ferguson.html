<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with historian and author Niall Ferguson. They discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent of world-ending narratives, how the global doomsday ethos abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class, the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today, and how we might strive to deal with genuine tragedy morally, religiously, and with humility.</p><p> </p><p>Niall Ferguson is a Scottish-American historian, author, columnist, TV presenter, and academic. He is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, as well as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Ferguson has written many books, such as “Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World,” “Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire,” “The Square and the Tower,” and most recently, “Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,” which has been shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber prize.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Niall Ferguson:</p><p> </p><p>Website https://www.niallferguson.com/</p><p> </p><p>Doom (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Doom-Politics-Catastrophe-Niall-Ferguson/dp/0593297377</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/nfergus?lang=en</p><p> </p><p>On Youtube https://www.youtube.com/@niallferguson5684/videos</p><p> </p>
