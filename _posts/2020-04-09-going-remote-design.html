<p>We&apos;re starting a new series of bonus episodes called Going Remote. We&apos;ll have different Basecampers answer questions about how they do their work remotely. In this first episode, design lead Jonas Downey talks about how he and his team collaborate with each other, give feedback, and communicate with their developer colleagues. These episodes are adapted from an ongoing series of livestreamed Q&amp;As, which you can find in their entirety on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwo5Hcps5IkC1PzDfnE72XlEoUCvknaq5'>Basecamp&apos;s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p><a href='https://youtu.be/nH9iYwSCYhI'>Video of Jonas&apos; Q&amp;A</a> | <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwo5Hcps5IkC1PzDfnE72XlEoUCvknaq5'>YouTube playlist</a> of all Q&amp;As - 00:33</p><p>Jonas Downey <a href='https://twitter.com/jonasdowney'>on Twitter</a> - 00:39</p><p>Question #1: I’m planning on doing design thinking sessions for groups.
