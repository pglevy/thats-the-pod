<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with filmmaker and activist Robby Starbuck. They discuss Robby’s choice to abandon the life of a Hollywood filmmaker, what broke his faith in the Democratic ideology, why a willingness to risk everything is necessary for substantive cultural change, exactly how Robby is taking on woke corporate America, and why it's working.</p><p> </p><p>Robby Starbuck, a filmmaker and anti-communist once directed Oscar-winning actors and some of the biggest music stars in the world but seeing the threat of Marxism in America set a fire inside him due to his own Mom and grandparents fleeing communism in Cuba. He knew he had to stand up. He started his public stand by endorsing Trump in the 2015 primary. Hollywood didn’t like that very much.</p><p> </p><p>This episode was filmed on September 20th, 2024</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Robby Starbuck:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://x.com/robbystarbuck?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p> </p><p>On Instagram https://www.instagram.com/robbystarbuck/?hl=en</p><p> </p><p>Website https://robbystarbuck.com/</p><p> </p><p>DEI Whistleblower page https://robbystarbuck.com/DEI/ </p>
