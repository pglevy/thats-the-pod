Iman Abuzeid (@ImanAbuzeid) just finished raising $15M for her nurse hiring platform Incredible Health which was led by Silicon Valley's premier venture fund Andreessen Horowitz. Growing up in a family where everyone (literally) were doctors, she naturally followed the same path. Except when she finished medical school and received her MD, she decided not to work as a doctor for even 1 day and went corporate. After being equipped with an MBA and consulting experience, she left to Silicon Valley to make her mark on the world. Listen to hear her story, her "framework" for how to think about your career, why she thinks being in silicon valley is a competitive advantage and how she pivoted her company from a failing startup to one of the most exciting startups of 2019.Â
