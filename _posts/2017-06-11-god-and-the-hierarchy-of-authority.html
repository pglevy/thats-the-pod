<p>Lecture 3 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories series at the Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto. Although I thought I might get to Genesis II in this third lecture, and begin talking about Adam & Eve, it didn't turn out that way. There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on :) .</p><p> </p>
