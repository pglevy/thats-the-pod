<p>Jordan and Tammy Peterson sit down with the screenwriter and director behind “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,” Joshua Weigel and the real life inspirations for the film, Bishop and Donna Martin. They discuss the presumption of understanding, parsing out falsehood from a message from God, how compassion spreads through giving, the miracle of adoption, and how the film came to be through hardship and grace.</p><p> </p><p>Joshua Weigel is an award-winning filmmaker with a unique ability to create deeply moving stories that transform and inspire action.  Josh began working closely with his wife, Rebekah, writing and producing award winning short films which he directed, culminating with what has become one of the most beloved short films of all-time, The Butterfly Circus, a viral phenomenon receiving over 100 million views, and garnering over 35 film festival awards, including the Clint Eastwood Filmmaker Award presented to Joshua by Clint Eastwood at the Carmel Film Festival.</p><p> </p><p>Bishop and Donna Martin run the church of Possum Trot in East Texas, where they along with the families of the community have taken in seventy-seven children through adoption. Their story is one of struggle and triumph, compassion and resolve. It was brought to film and to the world through Angel Studios and the Daily Wire.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>Buy Tickets to “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot”  https://www.angel.com/tickets/sound-of-hope-the-story-of-possum-trot?utm_source=google-ads&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwkJm0BhBxEiwAwT1AXNLKBwIwZgec8P6mId1nHLkQiJLyUWRUSU6RfngcU_rdJtWuStXtgxoCTpAQAvD_BwE</p><p> </p><p>“Sound of Hope” website https://www.angel.com/movies/sound-of-hope-the-story-of-possum-trot</p><p> </p><p>Press and Cast information https://www.angel.com/press/sound-of-hope-the-story-of-possum-trot </p>
