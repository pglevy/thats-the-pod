<p>In our second weekly compilation, we are investigating the various methods and practices that humans use to conceptualize God. This investigation leads us down the path of exploring meaning and wonder. What does it mean to live as though God exists? Why are we awestruck when viewing a beautiful painting? Why does walking inside a great Cathedral render us speechless? What is the relationship between these experiences and God?Â </p><p><br /></p><p>Jordan talks about how living as though god exists is some form of evidence that we as a society hold these values in high regard.</p><p> </p>
