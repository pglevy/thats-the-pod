<p>There's plenty of advice out there about how to have a better daily routine. But what's just bunk and what actually works to improve the quality of your day and your overall life?</p><p>My guest, medical-doctor-turned-science-educator Stuart Farrimond, took a deep dive into the research to find the authoritative answers to that question, and he shares them in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/3MOEfCu"><i>Live Your Best Life: 219 Science-Based Reasons to Rethink Your Daily Routine</i></a>. Today on the show, we walk through a daily routine, from morning to night, and Dr. Farrimond shares some best practices to make the most of it. We discuss why waking up to an alarm clock feels so terrible, why you shouldn't drink coffee first thing in the morning, the ideal length for an afternoon nap, how to improve your commute, the best time of day to exercise, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/sleep-science/">AoM Article: What Every Man Should Know About Sleep</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/the-digestive-power-of-an-after-dinner-walk/">AoM Article: The Digestive Power of an After-Dinner Walk</a></li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/10/meal-timing-big-meals/">"Itâ€™s Not Just What You Eat, but the Time of Day You Eat It"</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/12-tips-keep-snoring-bay/">AoM Article: How to Stop Your Snoring</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/unleash-the-power-of-the-nap/">AoM Article: Unleash the Power of the Nap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/sunday-firesides-your-routine-needs-rites-of-passage/">Sunday Firesides: Your Routine Needs Rites of Passage</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Stuart Farrimond</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/realdoctorstu/?hl=en">Stuart on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RealDoctorStu">Stuart on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/04/411VX4IA2KL._SL500_.jpg" alt="" />
