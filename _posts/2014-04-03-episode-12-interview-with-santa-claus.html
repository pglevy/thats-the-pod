<p>Welcome back to the Art of Manliness podcast. This week we bring you a special holiday edition of the Art of Manliness podcast with a very special guest: Santa Claus! Or at least a guy who works as Santa. Santa Dave (or Dave Davis) is a professional Santa Clause that lives in Ohio. He's a member of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas and also does story telling. You can find out more about Santa Dave's work and see pics of the big man himself at his website Christmas Lore.</p>
