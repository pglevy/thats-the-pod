Making art for a living, often under tight deadlines and high expectations, can be very stressful. But if we're stressed out all the time, we'll end up burning out. So how do we avoid stress in our work, even as we perform on a deadline? How can we manage multiple projects and give each one of them our best? And how can we do all this without burning out? Join me as I share the surprisingly simple ways that I've been able to take the edge off stress in my own work. Along the way, I hope to encourage you to keep going and not to let the little (and sometimes big) setbacks hold you back.</p><p><strong>IN THIS EPISODE</strong></p><p><strong>0:00 - Intro</strong></p><p><strong>0:00:39 -
