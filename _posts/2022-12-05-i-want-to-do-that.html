<p>In this episode, I talk about the very beginning of our journey into becoming illustrators, the moment we discover illustration and say to ourselves, “I want to do that.” This is what Lisa Congdon calls the “spark moment”. I will tell you the story of my own spark moment, which has an unlikely beginning and takes a very long and meandering path to get where I am today. By listening to this episode, you will be able to identify your own spark moment and to learn how to let that pull you forward toward your goal of becoming an illustrator. You should know what you want.</p><p>Take my classes!
