<p>In this episode we're going to talk about why your creativity NEEDS constraints! Even though they seem like setbacks, if we can embrace them, they can actually push us forward in our work. In Chapter 1, I'll tell you the story of how a concert went totally wrong — and how that resulted one of the best-selling Jazz albums of all time. In Chapter 2, I'll give you the 4 types of constraints you'll encounter in your illustration work, and how to use each one to push you forward in your own creativity!</p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend.</strong></p><p>This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at </strong><a href="http://patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>http://patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a></p><ul><li>$8 Drawing Buddies gain exclusive access to my monthly Draw With Me meetups.</li><li>Join for as low as $3 to get 20% off my 1-on-1 coaching sessions</li></ul><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes!</strong></p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.tomfroese.com/teaching">http://tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
