<p>We sit down with all five current Benchmark GPs for one of their legendary weekly dinners, during which we ask all of the unresolved burning questions from Part 1. How do THEY think about Benchmark v3? What are their day-to-day emotions trying to keep the equal partnership “bending toward greatness? Why is there no growth fund? What does it take to become the next Benchmark GP? Why is there a secret Principal program? We cover all these and much, much more. We also recorded the whole thing on video — which we highly recommend watching even if you normally only listen to the audio feed! </p><p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!).</p><p>Links:</p><ul><li>Please take our <a href="http://acquired.fm/survey">2022 Acquired Survey</a> if you have a minute.
