<p>We live in an age of disruption. Companies that were once stalwarts are overtaken by small, plucky upstarts. Our personal lives can also be disrupted. We lose a job or a business fails. </p><p>My guest today says that instead of waiting to be disrupted by outside forces, you're better off using techniques developed by intelligence agencies and the military to disrupt yourself first. His name is <a href="http://brycehoffman.com/" target="_blank">Bryce Hoffman</a> and he's the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101905972/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1101905972&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Red Teaming: How Your Business Can Conquer the Competition by Challenging Everything</em></a>. We begin our show discussing what red teaming is and the history of its development, from wargaming by 19th century Prussians to more sophisticated techniques developed by the US military during the war on terrorism. Bryce and I discuss the hidden biases that red teaming is designed to counter, and then get into the specific red teaming techniques you can start using today to challenge your assumptions, stress-test your strategies, identify unseen threats, and make better decisions in both your personal life and your business.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/redteaming" target="_blank">aom.is/redteaming</a>.</p>
