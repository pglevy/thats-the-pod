<p>I spoke December 7, 2018 with Bjørn Lomborg, author and President of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a singularly innovative and influential US-based think tank. Mr. Lomborg and his team have done the hard conceptual and empirical work necessary to turn good intentions for global improvement into implementable and economically efficient strategies. That's really saying something. </p><p> </p>
