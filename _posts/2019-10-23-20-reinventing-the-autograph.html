The infatuation of Celebrity is something we can all relate to and Steven Galanis (@Mr312) is making sure to take opportunity of that. When was the last time you got a celeb to sign something of yours? Nowadays you'd grab your phone in a heartbeat to snap a pic and share it on the gram or "it didn't happen". Steven built Cameo so you can just pay your favorite celebrity to say (almost) whatever you want. And it's becoming huge. It's a great story that I think you'd love to hear.Â
