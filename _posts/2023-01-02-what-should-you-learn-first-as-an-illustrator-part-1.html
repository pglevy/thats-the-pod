<p>In this episode and the next, we'll talk about what skills you need to learn in order to become an illustrator, especially at first . What are the things you need to learn, and in what order? This is one of the biggest and most confounding questions for beginners. While there is no one-size-fits-all path, there are definitely some basics everyone needs as their foundation. I will tell you what I I think the most important things to learn are at first, and give you a sense of what learning these might look like. By the end of this episode, you will have a clearer picture of where to focus your efforts in the first year or so of your illustration education.</p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
