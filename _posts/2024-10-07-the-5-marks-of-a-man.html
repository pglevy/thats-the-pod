<p>We often think of the difference between a boy and a man as a matter of age. But Brian Tome says that there can be 15-year-old men and 45-year-old boys, and that the real difference maker in being grown up isn't a matter of the number of years you accumulate but the qualities, behaviors, and mindset you possess.</p><p>Brian is a pastor and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3BymrrC"><i>The Five Marks of a Man</i></a>. Today on the show, Brian unpacks what he thinks are the marks of mature manhood. We talk about the need to have a vision and how life-giving hobbies can create that vision. Brian argues that manhood requires staking out a minority position, being part of a pack, and creating more than you consume. And we discuss the ways men can still be protectors in the 21st century.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/art-of-manliness-podcast-78-the-myth-of-following-your-passion/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #78: The Myth of Following Your Passion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/hobbies-for-men/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Ultimate List of Hobbies for Men — 75+ Ideas For Your Free Time</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/the-3-ps-of-manhood-a-review/" target="_blank">AoM series on the 3 P's of Manhood: Protect, Procreate, Provide </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/podcast-926-the-5-shifts-of-manhood/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #926: The 5 Shifts of Manhood</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/how-to-turn-a-boy-into-a-man/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #810: How to Turn a Boy Into a Man</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/why-are-women-s-friendships-the-ideal/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Why Are Female Friendships the Ideal?
