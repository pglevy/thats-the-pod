<p>The human body is capable of doing a wide variety of movements, in a variety of environments. But my guest today argues that most modern people only do a few movements each day, commonly find themselves stuck in sterile surroundings, and that these confinements are sapping our physical and psychological health.</p><p>His name is Erwan Le Corre and heâ€™s the founder of the <a href="http://movnat.com" target="_blank">MovNat physical fitness system</a> and the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/162860283X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=162860283X&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Practice of Natural Movement: Reclaim Power, Health, and Freedom</em></a>. Today on the show Erwan explains what natural movement is, and our amazing human potential for walking, running, balancing, jumping, crawling, climbing, swimming, lifting, carrying, throwing, catching, and self-defense. We then discuss the cultural forces that have disconnected us and our children from our ability to perform these natural movements, and have turned us into "zoo humans." Erwan and I then dig into the benefits of engaging with natural movements, from improved mental and physical health to a greater sense of freedom. We end our conversation with Erwan's actionable advice on how you can easily incorporate more natural movement into your daily life.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/naturalmovement" target="_blank">aom.is/naturalmovement</a>.</p>
