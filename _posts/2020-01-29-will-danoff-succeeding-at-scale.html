<p><p>Our guest this week is Will Danoff. Will runs a number of Fidelity equity strategies, best known of which is Fidelity Contrafund, a mutual fund he has been managing since September 1990. During his nearly three-decade tenure at Contrafund, Will has trounced the market indexes and, even more remarkably, managed to maintain the fund's performance at scale. Indeed, Contrafund was recently home to more than $120 billion in assets and has ranked among the world's largest funds for many years. For his accomplishments, Morningstar named Will its Domestic-Stock Manager of the Year in 2007. Prior to becoming a portfolio manager, Will served as a retail analyst at Fidelity and for a time as assistant portfolio manager at Fidelity Magellan. He's a graduate of Harvard University and earned his MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. We're thrilled to have him as our guest.</p></p><p><p><strong>Background</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/analysis/316071109?documentType=QAA" target="_blank">Will Danoff bio</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fcntx/quote">Fidelity Contrafund</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AO3r/fidelity-investments-letters" target="_blank">“Letters”, Fidelity Investments TV commercial</a> </p></p><p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lynch " target="_blank">Peter Lynch bio</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Meetings with Management</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://trianpartners.com/people/nelson-peltz/" target="_blank">Nelson Peltz bio</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Idea Generation</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/" target="_blank">Salesforce Dreamforce conference</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/analysis/316345305?documentType=QAA" target="_blank">Joel Tillinghast</a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/flpsx/quote">Fidelity Low-Priced Stock</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Circle of Competence</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://investor.ryanair.com/directors/" target="_blank">Michael O’Leary, Michael Cawley bios</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Portfolio Construction<br /></p><p></strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Pik" target="_blank">Corporate profit margins</a></p></p><p><p><strong>Investing in Private Firms</strong></p></p><p><p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2016/33-10233.pdf" target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission’s “Investment Company Liquidity Risk Management Program”</a> </p></p>
