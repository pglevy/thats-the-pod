<p>Steve Eisman became a famous name in the investing world due to his prescient bet against the US housing market before 2008, which led to his starring role in Michael Lewis' book The Big Short. These days his investing approach looks a little bit more conventional in his role as a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. But he still has big ideas. These days he sees three dominant macro stories for investors: AI, infrastructure and crypto. The last one he just fundamentally rejects. The first two, however, he sees as tailwinds that can potentially last a long time. He's been looking for companies that can capitalize on trends like nearshoring, the Inflation Reduction Act, and power-hungry datacenters. In this episode show, we he discusses where we are in this big cycle. He also tells us about his love of comic books, and what he sees as the core problem with the Marvel franchise.Â </p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>
