However, the true essence behind the Stoics penning their wisdom lies in their understanding of our inherent vulnerability.</p><p>* “The Stoics give us amazing resources for being able to ask ‘Was my judgement of what happened out there and my emotional response to it—anger, fear, desire, distress—grounded? Was I attached to the correct values?’”</p><p>* Fast thinking, when not used for survival, can be caused out of habits of personal bias that we’re not even aware of. </p><p><em>PAC would like to extend their deepest gratitude to Adam Piercey of </em><em>Modern Stoicism</em><em> for hosting, conducting, and providing this interview. </em></p><p></p> <br/><br/>Get full access to Plato's Academy Centre Newsletter at <a href="https://platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTE5ODY2NiwiaWF0IjoxNzA4ODM0NjY1LCJleHAiOjE3MTE0MjY2NjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTk0NTEyIiwic3ViIjoiY2hlY2tvdXQifQ.dY7f9hfeN1pSWp4rXGIriFFtkR1Oe3juiS552cg7I5M&#38;utm_medium=podcast&#38;utm_campaign=CTA_4">platosacademycentre.substack.com/subscribe</a>
