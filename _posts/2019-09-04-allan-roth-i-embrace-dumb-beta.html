<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Allan Roth, one of the pre-eminent hourly financial advisors in the United States. After a career in corporate finance and as a consultant for McKinsey and Company, Roth started the holistic financial advisory firm Wealth Logic in 2003. Wealth Logic focuses on financial planning and ultra-low-cost simplified investing; his firm's motto is "Dare to be Dull." In addition to working directly with clients, Roth is a prolific writer: He's the author of <em>How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street,</em> which was published in 2009 with the second edition in 2011, and he's also a  regular contributor to <em>Financial Planning</em> magazine, Advisor Perspectives, ETF.com, and AARP. </p>
