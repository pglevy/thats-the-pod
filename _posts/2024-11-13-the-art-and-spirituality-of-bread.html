<p>Think about a hot loaf of bread fresh out of the oven.</p><p>There's a lot going on with that loaf.</p><p>On one level, it's a literal food that's been created through chemical processes. A delicious — your mouth might be watering right now — form of sustenance.</p><p>But there's also more to it than that. There's something about bread, the so-called staff of life, that's different from other foods and resonates on a deeper level. There's a reason bread has been a rich symbol throughout times and cultures and figures prominently in religious scriptures.</p><p>Today on the show, Peter Reinhart will take us on an exploration of the many facets of bread, from the spiritual to the scientific. Peter is a baker, educator, and the author of numerous books, including <a href="https://amzn.to/48JSgdm"><i>The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread</i></a>. In the first half of our conversation, Peter unpacks the deeper, mystical meanings of bread by walking us through the twelve steps of how it's made. We then get into why sourdough is the future and final frontier of bread, and the technical secrets to mixing, fermenting, and baking a killer loaf.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4fwvF6d" target="_blank">Peter's books</a></li><li>Peter's recipes for overnight fermented lean dough and more</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK8Yk3mEEb8" target="_blank">Peter's TED talk</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/food-drink/bread-baking-101-beginners/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Bread Baking 101 for Beginners</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Peter Reinhart</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.fornobravo.com/pizzaquest/" target="_blank">Peter's Pizza Quest website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/11/81XWABBLt3L._SL1200_.jpg" alt="The cover of "The Bread Baker's Apprentice" beautifully captures the art of baking, showcasing a person in a chef outfit holding a large loaf of bread.
