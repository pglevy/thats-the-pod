<p>The right to speak is critically important to allow our civilization not only to thrive but to survive. In part 2 of this compilation, we examine the power of free speech and potential responses to censorship. </p><p><br /></p><p>After a lecture excerpt on the “initial defeat of the hero,” we transition into podcast clips on hate crime laws, the idea behind 'No Safe Spaces,’ and the events that lead Paul Rossi, a NY private school teacher, to take a stand against seminars on "white dominant culture" being taught as gospel.
