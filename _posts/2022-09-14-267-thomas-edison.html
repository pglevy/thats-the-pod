He is 11 years old.</p><p><strong>He reads the entire library. Every book. All of them</strong>.</p><p>At this point in history the telegraph is the leading edge of communication technology in the world.</p><p><strong>My refuge was a Detroit public library.

It is earned.</strong> If you're going to research something, this is your lucky day. <strong>Information is freely available on the internet — that's the good news. The bad news is that you now have zero excuse for not being the most knowledgeable in any subject you want because it's right there at your fingertips.</strong></p><p>Why his work on the telegraph was so important to everything that happened later in his life: The germs of many ideas and stratagems perfected by him in later years were implanted in his mind when he worked at the telegraph. He described this phase of his life afterward, his mind was in a tumult, besieged by all sorts of ideas and schemes. All the future potentialities of electricity obsessed him night and day. It was then that he dared to hope that he would become an inventor.</p><p>Edison’s insane schedule: Though he had worked up to an early hour of the morning at the telegraph office, Edison began reading the <a href="https://amzn.to/3DpIRKo">Experimental Researches In Electricity</a> (Faraday’s book) when he returned to his room at 4 A.M. and continued throughout the day that followed, so that he went back to his telegraph without having slept. He was filled with determination to learn all he could.</p><p>All the Thomas Edison episodes:</p><p><a href="http://amzn.to/2nkWALm">The Wizard of Menlo Park: How Thomas Alva Edison Invented The Modern World</a> by Randall Stross (Founders #3)</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eCkM4s">Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World</a> by Jill Jonnes.

Jay Gould saw the importance of the telegraph industry in part because telegraph lines were laid next to railraod tracks.</p><p>Edison describes the fights between the robber barons as strange financial warfare.</p><p>You should build a company that you actually enjoy working in.</p><p>Don’t make this mistake:</p><p>John Ott who served under Edison for half a century, at the end of his life described the "sacrifices" some of Edison's old co-workers had made, and he commented on their reasons for so doing.</p><p>"My children grew up without knowing their father," he said. "When I did get home at night, which was seldom, they were in bed."</p><p>"Why did you do it?" he was asked.</p><p>"Because Edison made your work interesting. He made me feel that I was making something with him. I wasn't just a workman.
