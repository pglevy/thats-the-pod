Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) answer your questions:

(3:40) What are you both investing in?

(16:16) Please update us on your rolling fund. Is it what you expected? Are you more or less bullish on it?

(21:25) What do you not get a chance to talk about (either because it's off-topic/lower priority) that you wish you could?

(23:08) You guys are awesome at coming up with incredible ideas and knowing how to execute them. What would it take for one to pull you out of Twitch and want to pursue in full force?

(27:24) Shaan how do you balance side hustles while still outperforming at Twitch?

(33:06) Whoâ€™s the worst person you admire?

(39:29) Should you hire your friends?

(44:19) Who can squat more weight?

(44:40) What are the biggest insecurities, both of you struggle with?

(48:30) Since covid is pretty much a thing of the past...when will the MFM meetup be?
