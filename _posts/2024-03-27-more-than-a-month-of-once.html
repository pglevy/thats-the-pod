<p>In this episode of REWORK, host Kimberly Rhodes sits down with the co-founders of 37signals, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, to provide an update on their latest product — Campfire, under the <a href='https://once.com/'>Once</a> umbrella — just about one month after its initial launch. Once introduces a new software paradigm where users pay just once and own it forever, departing from the conventional subscription model. The discussion delves into their pricing strategy, their emphasis on long-term profitability over immediate gains, and offers insights into what lies ahead for Once.</p><p><b>Key Takeaways:</b><br/><br/>00:32 - Initial Reflections: Once, 30 Days In <br/><br/>02:03 - Setting Benchmarks: Unveiling Novel Concepts for Long-Term Success <br/><br/>09:58 - Embracing the Journey: Finding Joy in the Process <br/><br/>13:39 - Looking Forward: The Future Trajectory of Once <br/><br/>15:53 - Taking Risks: Navigating the Gambles of Product Launches <br/><br/>23:24 - Pricing Puzzles: Deciphering the Right Value<br/><br/><b>Links and Resources:</b></p><p><a href='https://once.com/'>Once. com</a> and <a href='https://once.com/campfire'>Campfire</a><br/><a href='https://37signals.com/books'>Books by 37signals</a><br/><a href='https://basecamp.com/pricing'>Sign up for a 30-day free trial at Basecamp.com</a><br/> <a href='https://www.hey.com/'>HEY.com</a><br/><a href='https://www.rework.fm/'><em>The REWORK podcast</em></a><em><br/></em><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@37signals/podcasts'>The Rework Podcast on YouTube</a><br/><a href='https://dev.37signals.com/'>The 37signals Dev Blog</a><br/><a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/basecamp/featured'>37signals on YouTube</a><br/><a href='https://twitter.com/37signals'>@37signals on X</a> </p>
