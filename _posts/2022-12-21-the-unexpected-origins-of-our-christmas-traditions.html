<p>With Christmas coming up, you're likely in the full holiday swing of things — decorating your tree, eating certain foods, listening to particular music, and buying and wrapping gifts. But did you ever stop to think about <i>why</i> it is you're taking part in this slate of often weird-but-wonderful traditions?</p><p>Brian Earl has traced the backstories of our Christmas traditions in his podcast and book called <a href="https://amzn.to/3WAjlsa"><i>ChristmasPast</i></a>. Today on the show, he shares some of those backstories with us, and explains how many of our seemingly fated and timeless traditions actually came about in fluky and fortuitous ways and are a lot more recent than we think. He first unpacks how Christmas went from being a small religious observance to a huge cultural celebration and how our idea of Santa Claus evolved over time, with our current conception of Old St. Nick being less than a century old. We then discuss how it is we ended up taking evergreen trees inside our houses and decorating them, the origins of the most recorded Christmas song in history, why fruitcake became the butt of jokes, and why hardly anyone roasts chestnuts anymore, on an open fire or otherwise. Brian shares what new Christmas traditions he's seeing emerge and which classic ones are going away, and I offer an important PSA to future parents about Elf on the Shelf. We end our conversation with Brian's tips for getting into the Christmas spirit if you haven't been feeling it.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/food-drink/how-to-roast-chestnuts-over-an-open-fire/">AoM Article and Video: How to Roast Chestnuts on an Open Fire</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/be-a-scrooge-this-year-reflections-from-a-christmas-carol/">AoM Article: Be a Scrooge This Year — Reflections From A Christmas Carol</a></li><li><a href="http://apsabourin.com/blog/santa-claus-through-the-years.php">The evolving image of Santa Claus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/12/18/celebrating-christmas-and-the-holidays-then-and-now/">Pew Research study on the changing ways Americans celebrate Christmas</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/12/18/celebrating-christmas-and-the-holidays-then-and-now/">Vintage Flintstones Fruity Pebbles Christmas commercial</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xi-kKMBNe0">Vintage McDonald's Christmas commercial</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/11-ways-to-get-into-the-holiday-spirit/">AoM Article: 11 Ways to Get Into the Holiday Spirit</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Brian Earl</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://christmaspastpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Brian's Website and Podcast</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/12/A1tDBXEoVCL.jpg" alt="" />
