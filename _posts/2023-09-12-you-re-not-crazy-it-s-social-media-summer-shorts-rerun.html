<p>With Social Media, we simply can't do it all. There are too many platforms and too many different content types, and if we tried to consistently do all of them, or even a handful of them, we'd have no time to do our actual job!</p><p>But the fear of missed opportunities (by not participating on all the popular apps) is real! So how do we balance the need to share on social media (yes, we do need to use it!) with staying productive and even staying sane?</p><p>Please join me as I explore the topic of Social Media.</p><p> </p><p>THIS IS A RE-RUN EPISODE FROM MY PATRONS ONLY SUMMER SHORTS SERIES</p><p>———</p><h3>In This Episode</h3><ul><li>What the heck am I doing on Social Media? Taking stock of all the apps I share on</li><li>My experience: Social media is like a gambling addiction</li><li>How social media can get out of control and steal all your time</li><li>It's not you that's crazy — it's social media! We're all expected to make all this very time-intensive content for free, at the expense of getting to do our actual work.</li><li>Myth: content creation = the most important work we do</li><li>Positives of Social Media: Gives us a platform for sharing and building an audience around the work we're excited about.</li><li>SM is the tool, not us — we shouldn't be working for SM, it needs to work for us.</li><li>Why we NEED to use SM</li><li>How to know what to focus on: What are the 1 or 2 platforms that do the following:</li><li>1) Makes us more productive/creative</li><li>2) Somehow helps generate income or new business</li><li>Let all the others go. Abandon them, or just relegate them to lower, more supporting roles for your main SM platforms.</li><li>Backwards relationship: Making content to share, vs. Sharing what we make.</li><li>Focus = Sacrifice. By letting go of some SM apps, you WILL miss out on some opportunities.</li><li>Choosing apps that help you share what you want to share best.</li><li>Depth and Focus are more important than trying to "do it all".</li><li>How does your social media use (as a content creator) help or hinder your creative work?</li><li>Conclusion: Asking what value our content provides for others?</li></ul><p>———</p><h3>What Social Media Works Best For You?</h3><p>Please share your thoughts! What apps work best for the kind of content you want to share? What do you think about making content to share vs. sharing work you made for some other reason?
