<p>We sit down with perhaps the only person besides Marc Andreessen who’s had a major influence on each of the Web 1, 2 and 3 eras: Brave Browser CEO (and former Netscape + Mozilla Chief Architect) Brendan Eich. In true Acquired fashion we cover both a huge amount of both internet history AND internet future in one awesome conversation. Big thank you to Brendan for making this so special — tune in!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>This episode has video!
