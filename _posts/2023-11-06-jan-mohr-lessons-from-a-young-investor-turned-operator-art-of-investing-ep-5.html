Our teacher today is Jan Mohr. Jan is an investor turned operator who is currently CEO of Chapters Group, a publicly traded holding company building Europe's home for mission-critical businesses. This class is first and foremost about a young aspiring value investor who embodies a fascinating combination of German discipline and sensibility with a more American risk-taking and entrepreneurial spirit on his quest to continue reimagining what's possible in a life and career. 
At just 33, he has already traveled well up the compounding curve and has a great deal of wisdom and lessons to share. We hope you enjoy our class today with Jan Mohr.
