<p>Welcome to the first episode of Rework! This podcast is based on Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson&apos;s 2010 best-selling business book, which was itself based on years of blogging. So what better way to kick off this show than talking about byproducts? In this episode, Jason explains how Basecamp&apos;s ideas have been packaged as blog posts, workshops, and books. We also visit a 145-year-old sawmill in Ontario, Canada to see how this family-owned business sells its physical byproducts.</p>
