<p><em>This is a re-broadcast. The episode originally ran in October 2018. </em></p>
<p>Do your days seem like a continuous blur of busyness, and yet you don’t seem to get much done, nor remember much about how you spent your time?</p>
<p>As a former employee of Google, my guest today worked on the very apps and technology that can often suck away our time. Today, he’s dedicated to figuring out how to push back against these forces to help people take control of their time and attention.</p>
<p>His name is John Zeratsky and he’s the co-author of the book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078QSCM3V/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B078QSCM3V&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</a>.</em> Today on the show, John shares how the experience of feeling like he was missing months of his life led him to spending years experimenting with his habits and routines, looking for the best ways to to optimize energy, focus, and time. He then shares the simple 4-step daily framework that developed from this research and walks us through that system. John talks about choosing one “highlight” each day to ensure your most important work gets done and that your life is full of memorable moments. He also shares how to reduce the time you spend wading in what he calls “infinity pools,” why energy management is just as important as time management, and how reflection is essential in figuring out if what you’re doing is working.</p>
<p>Lots of valuable direction in this show for how to get your life on track and find more hours and meaning in the day.</p>
