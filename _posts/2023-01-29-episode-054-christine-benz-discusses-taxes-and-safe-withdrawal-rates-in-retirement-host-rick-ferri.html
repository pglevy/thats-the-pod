<p><a href='https://www.morningstar.com/authors/30/christine-benz'>Christine Benz</a>, CFP®, is Morningstar's Director of Personal Finance and the co-host of The Long View Podcast. We discuss 2022 taxes and how SECURE Act 2.0 will affect 2023 taxes and beyond. We also dive into a safe withdrawal rate during retirement and discuss how changing market valuations, inflation expectations, and the "spending smile" during retirement that affects the amount you can reasonably withdraw.</p>
