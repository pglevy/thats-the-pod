<p>In today's episode I talk to author Christopher Klein about his new biography of famed 19th century boxer John L. Sullivan (he's the &quot;boxer man&quot; that serves as the unofficial logo of the Art of Manliness). Klein and I talk about this larger-than-life character and his influence on boxing and modern ideals of manhood in America today.</p>
