<p>What does it mean to live a good life? How can we achieve that good life? </p><p>These are questions a Greek philosopher explored over 2,000 years ago in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449493/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140449493&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></a>. My guest today argues that the insights Aristotle uncovered millennia ago are still pertinent to us in the 21st century. Her name is <a href="http://edithhall.co.uk" target="_blank">Edith Hall</a>, and she’s a classicist and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735220808/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735220808&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Aristotle’s Way: How Ancient Wisdom Can Change Your Life</em></a>. Today on the show we discuss what Aristotle thought the good life was and how it’s different from our modern conception of happiness. We then dig into how Aristotle believed the cultivation of virtue was a key part of living a flourishing life and why understanding your unique potential and purpose is also important. Edith then shares insights from Aristotle on how to handle misfortune and become a better decision maker, as well as the importance of relationships to human happiness.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/aristotle" target="_blank">aom.is/aristotle</a>.</p>
