<p>Welcome back to another episode of The Art of Manliness Podcast! In this edition we talk to Ben Thompson, author of the new book, Badass: A Relentless Onslaught of the Toughest Warlords, Vikings, Samurai, Pirates, Gunfighters, and Military Commanders to Ever Live. He's also the owner and founder of the popular website, badassofthweek.com.<br />We talk about some of the badasses from history that Ben highlights in his book.<br />Oh, and as you can imagine, we say badass alot in the interview, so if that sort of thing bothers you, you should probably skip this episode.</p>
