<p>Whole30 began as a dietary experiment: For 30 days, Melissa Urban went without grains, dairy, legumes, alcohol and added sugar. She was trying to address several health problems, and the results were so extraordinary that she decided to share the diet with others.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>What followed was a blog, a series of seminars, a best-selling book and eventually a wide-ranging wellness brand that’s helped millions of people identify the best diet for their own body. But in 2015, Melissa had to rethink everything—even her own name—when she split up with her husband and business partner, Dallas Hartwig. She retained ownership of the business, and today, the “Whole30 Approved” logo appears on a range of brands, from La Croix water to Chipotle salad bowls.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Katherine Sypher. Our audio engineers were Patrick Murray, Gilly Moon, and Robert Rodriguez.</p><p>You can follow HIBT on <a href="https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>
