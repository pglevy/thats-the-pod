<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with Brett Johnson, formerly the United States’ most wanted cyber criminal, now a public speaker and expert on cyber security. They discuss the nurturing of a child into a criminal, the compartmentalization of guilt, the psychology of exploitation, the creation of the precursor to the dark web, and what caused Johnson to walk away completely.</p><p> </p><p>Brett Johnson. Former U.S. Most Wanted Cybercriminal. Now Good Guy. The United States Secret Service called Mr. Johnson "The Original Internet Godfather" for his role in refining modern financial cybercrime. Or to put it another way: Brett was convicted of 39 felonies, placed on the U.S. Most Wanted List, escaped from prison, and … he built the first organized cybercrime community, Shadowcrew. Shadowcrew was a precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets, and it laid the foundation for the way modern cybercrime channels operate today. Johnson was sentenced to 90 months in Federal Prison. End of story? Not hardly. Brett found redemption through his sister, his wife Michele, and finally the FBI. He was given the chance to turn his life around. He took it. Today, Brett is considered one of the leading authorities on cybercrime, identity theft, and cybersecurity on the planet. He works hard to protect businesses and consumers from the type of person he used to be.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Brett Johnson:</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/gollumfun?lang=en</p><p> </p><p>On LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/gollumfun/</p><p> </p><p>The Brett Johnson Show (website)  https://www.thebrettjohnsonshow.com/</p><p> </p><p>The Brett Johnson Show (youtube) https://www.youtube.com/@brettjohnsonshow </p>
