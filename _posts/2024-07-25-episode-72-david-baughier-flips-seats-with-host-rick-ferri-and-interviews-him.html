<p>David Baughier switched seats with host Rick Ferri and interviewed him about many personal finance topics. David is a retired Naval Officer with a passion for helping people pursue and achieve financial independence. He is the founder of <a href='http://www.fiology.com'>www.fiology.com</a>, a free resource that escorts you through 52 concepts of financial independence over the course of one year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This podcast highlights the first 50 minutes of David's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf-z4ebsieMP3ALcADzc8BXJryu9MUAza'>The Forget About Money </a>YouTube video, which we recorded in May 2024. We discussed a diverse set of topics, from John Bogle to asset allocation to the biases in most investment advice. The podcast is David’s latest passion project, and it encourages you to take action today so that you can focus on what matters most to you.</p>
