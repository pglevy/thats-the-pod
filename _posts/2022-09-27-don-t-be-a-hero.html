<p>You&apos;ve been working on a thing for days, weeks, maybe months and you&apos;re still nowhere near finishing. Our natural instinct is to say, &quot;I&apos;ve already put this much time and energy into it, might as well finish.&quot; Well, most of the time this is wrong. You&apos;re not getting that time back either way and usually the better option is just to quit!</p>
