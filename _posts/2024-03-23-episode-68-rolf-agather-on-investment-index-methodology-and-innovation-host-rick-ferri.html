<p>More than 50 percent of mutual fund and ETF assets track passive indices, which makes index methodology important. Episode 68 is all about index history and evolution and how the usage of indexes as investment products changed the industry. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rolf Agather has been in the indexing industry since the 1980s. He started Russell, moved around the industry a bit, then went back to Russell Investments and in 2002 became the Managing Director, Research and Innovation, Russell Indexes. He remained there after a merger with FTSE and became the FTSE Russell Managing Director, Research, North America. Rolf moved to Morningstar in 2020 as Morningstar’s Head of Research and Product, Indexes.</p>
