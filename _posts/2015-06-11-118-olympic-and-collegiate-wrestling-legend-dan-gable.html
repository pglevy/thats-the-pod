<p>In this episode I talk with the legendary wrestler and wrestling coach Dan Gable. He won the 1972 gold medal in Munich without giving up a single point, and won 15 championships as a coach at the University of Iowa between 1976 and 1997. His new book is called &quot;A Wrestling Life: The Inspiring Stories of Dan Gable.&quot;</p>
