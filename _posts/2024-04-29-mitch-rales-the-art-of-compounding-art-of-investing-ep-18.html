Today’s teacher is Mitch Rales, one of the most iconic business builders and philanthropists of our time. Consider that Danaher has annualized at over 21% for four decades, resulting in an 1800-times multiple on invested capital!
You’ll learn from Mitch about the key inputs to his outlier success: why greatness is a journey that takes an unusual time horizon, the role benchmarking plays in standing up any winning organization, why it is essential to cultivate learning agility and embrace transformational pivots over time, and also the qualities Mitch looks for both in the leaders and businesses he looks to support.
While Mitch is a natural teacher, this is actually his first recorded, long-form interview of any kind, and so we feel especially honored to share with you our candid conversation with someone who has shaped and transformed us and the business world in so many positive ways. Please enjoy today’s class with Mitch Rales.
