<p>Here we continue our conversation about getting feedback on our work. The last episode was focused on getting positive feedback and how that can be important too, but the best way to grow is by getting CRITICAL feedback, or CRITIQUE. This opens us up to bruised egos and discouragement, but in the end, if we want to grow, we really need it. In this episode I share one experience in getting feedback on my work, and how it both stung and helped me grow. I then give some ways in which we can seek critical feedback on purpose — who can we reach out to for it, and how can we get the most out of it?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
