<p>Filling out paperwork. Making travel reservations. Paying bills. Shopping for groceries. Returning packages.</p><p>These are all examples of life admin — the little tasks we have to do to keep our lives moving along.</p><p>Life admin is typically pretty tedious and annoying. But staying on top of it is essential to reducing the stress and chaos that would otherwise burden our relationships, muck up the gears of our schedules, and prevent us from participating in all the fun and fulfilling parts of life.</p><p>Fortunately, there are ways to better manage your life admin. Here to share some of them is Dinah Rowe-Roberts, the co-host of the Life Admin Life Hacks podcast and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3zHooB2">co-author of a book of the same name</a>.
