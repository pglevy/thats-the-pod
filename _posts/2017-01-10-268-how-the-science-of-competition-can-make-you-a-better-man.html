<p>What if I told you that there’s a performance-enhancing drug that’s completely free, completely legal, and has no ill side-effects when used correctly? Oh, and you’ve probably already taken it many times in your life.<br />Competition is that drug, and today on the show I talk to author Po Bronson about his book &quot;Top Dog: The Science of Winning and Losing,&quot; which digs deep into the science of competition and how it can improve our performance in a wide variety of tasks.<br />In today’s podcast, Po and I discuss the difference between adaptive and maladaptive competition, the culture of virtuous competition that existed amongst the ancient Greeks, and how you can shape competition to make you a better man in all aspects of your life.</p>
