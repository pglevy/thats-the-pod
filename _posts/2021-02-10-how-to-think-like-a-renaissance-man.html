<p>When we think about the Renaissance, we think of a great flowering in artistic creativity and intellectual innovation; we think about the beautiful paintings and sculptures of Michelangelo, the astute discoveries of Copernicus, the timeless plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Ironically though, this great creative flowering was spurred by men who were educated under a system that, by our modern lights, can seem rather rigid and rote. </p>
<p>My guest today unpacks this seeming paradox. His name is <a href="https://www.scottnewstok.com/">Scott Newstok</a>, and he's a professor of English and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691177082/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0691177082&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>How to Think Like Shakespeare: Lessons From a Renaissance Education</em></a>, in which he uses the Bard as a jumping off point to explore broader insights into matters of the mind. We begin our conversation with the ways Scott thinks our modern educational system is lacking, and how students' approach to learning has changed over the years. We then discuss how the Renaissance model of education, with its emphasis on language and verbal fluency, provides possibilities for strengthening our reading, writing, speaking, and thinking skills and making their refinement a lifelong habit. We delve into how artists and thinkers in the Renaissance thought about originality differently than we do, and how they believed that imitating and even copying the work of others can actually help you find your own voice. And we discuss how Shakepeare's sonnets demonstrate the way in which constraints can counterintuitively enable creativity. We end our conversation with how you can incorporate Renaissance thinking into your day to day life.</p>
