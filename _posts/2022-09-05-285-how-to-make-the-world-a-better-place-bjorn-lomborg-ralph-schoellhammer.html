<p>Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh</p><p>Leftist politicians and the “intellectual elite” prioritize a vague plan for saving earth over the lives of struggling people all over the world. Governments are being forced to press their citizens, straining already fragile economic and agricultural systems, in order to appease a globalist utopian vision. Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer sit down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the faults in this plan, and the people who are suffering because of it.</p><p>Bjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.</p><p>Ralph Schoellhammer is a scholar and journalist operating in Europe who has diligently covered overlooked stories such as the Dutch Farmers Protest. He is also an assistant Professor of international relations at Webster Vienna Private University, and produces a podcast following political psychology and institutionalism called the Global Wire.</p><p> </p><p>—Links— </p><p>For Lomborg</p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.lomborg.com/">https://www.lomborg.com/</a></p><p>"What are the smartest solutions for the world?” We did a big book with 50+ teams of economists and several Nobel Laureates, but you can skip to the<a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/post2015brochure_m.pdf"> one-pager here</a></p><p>Thinking about climate, read my<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520304157"> free, peer-reviewed article</a>, or my new book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1541647467/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=copenhagencon-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1541647467&linkId=3d85b64ef21c87397ee32796d8cc75b6"> False Alarm</a>."</p><p> </p><p>For Schoellhammer</p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.ralphschoellhammer.net/">https://www.ralphschoellhammer.net/</a></p><p>Article: <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/popular-uprising-against-elites-has-gone-global-opinion-1722653">https://www.newsweek.com/popular-uprising-against-elites-has-gone-global-opinion-1722653</a></p><p>Article: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-europe-hedges-its-support-for-ukraine-russia-crude-oil-lng-gas-imports-exports-kyiv-war-eu-membership-zelensky-putin-germany-france-poland-11653247453">https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-europe-hedges-its-support-for-ukraine-russia-crude-oil-lng-gas-imports-exports-kyiv-war-eu-membership-zelensky-putin-germany-france-poland-11653247453</a></p><p>Podcast:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mxvf7TXw5YfadBmBqGxAg?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3mxvf7TXw5YfadBmBqGxAg?view_as=subscriber</a></p><p> </p><p>// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //</p><p>Newsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup</p><p>Donations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate</p><p> </p><p>// COURSES //</p><p>Discovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality</p><p>Self Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com</p><p>Understand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com</p><p> </p><p>// BOOKS //</p><p>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order</p><p>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life</p><p>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning</p><p> </p><p>// LINKS //</p><p>Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com</p><p>Events: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events</p><p>Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog</p><p>Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast</p><p> </p><p>// SOCIAL //</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson</p><p>Instagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson</p><p>Facebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson</p><p>Telegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson</p><p>All socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson</p><p> </p><p>#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus</p><p> </p><p> </p>
