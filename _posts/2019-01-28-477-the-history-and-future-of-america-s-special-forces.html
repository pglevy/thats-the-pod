<p>When people talk about military special forces, the Navy SEALs are often the first to come to mind. But there are several special forces in the military that have a storied history and play a fundamental role in America’s military defense. My guest today is the only person to have been allowed to audit and write about the training programs of the respective special forces units of every branch of the military.</p><p>His name is <a href="http://dickcouch.com" target="_blank">Dick Couch</a>. He’s a retired US Navy SEAL and the author of several books on America's special operations forces. Today on the show, we particularly discuss his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425253600/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0425253600&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Sua Sponte: The Forging of a Modern American Ranger</em></a>.</p><p>We begin our conversation discussing the history and varied purposes of the military's different special operations forces. Dick then explains how a soldier becomes an Army Ranger and why going to Ranger School isn’t the thing that makes you a Ranger. He walks us through the process of becoming a Ranger, including Ranger Assessment and Selection. We end our conversation discussing the role special operations forces will play in the future of America’s military. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/armyranger" target="_blank">aom.is/armyranger</a>.</p>
