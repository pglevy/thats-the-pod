<p>It’s a question that philosophers have taken on since Aristotle.<br />What makes something funny?<br />Going beyond that– why do we laugh in the first place? Because if you step back and look at it, laughing is pretty dang weird.<br />Well, my guest today on the podcast went on a world wide tour to uncover the science of humor. His name is Peter McGraw. He’s a behavioral scientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder and he’s the co-author of the book The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny. Today on the podcast Peter and I discuss the findings from his research around the world as well as in his humor lab at the University of Colorado. If you’re looking to add a bit more humor into your life, you won’t want to miss this.</p>
