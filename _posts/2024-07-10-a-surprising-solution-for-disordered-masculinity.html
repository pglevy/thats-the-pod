<p>There has been a lot of media coverage and dialogue about the struggles men are facing in the modern day. There's been some solutions forwarded to these struggles as well. Among these, Dr. Anthony Bradley has a more surprising idea that you don't hear every day: revitalizing college fraternities.</p><p>Anthony is a research fellow and professor and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3VXA7mm"><i>Heroic Fraternities: How College Men Can Save Universities and America</i></a>. In the first part of our conversation, Anthony offers his take on the state of men in the modern day, the difference between heroic and disordered masculinity, the insights that a writer from the mid-20-century can shed on the forms that disorder can take, and why many men today are choosing the path of resignation. We then turn to Anthony's idea that college fraternities can be the training ground for virtue. We talk about the loftier origins of fraternities, why, at some universities, they devolved into organizations that have become symbolic of the worst traits of masculinity, and Anthony's six principles for reviving the potential of fraternities to shape great men.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4brxAa0" target="_blank"><i>Neurosis and Human Growth: The Struggle Towards Self-Realization</i> by Karen Horney</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/entertainment/the-epic-story-of-the-making-of-the-godfather/">AoM Podcast #758: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dranthonybradley.com/masculinity-resources" target="_blank">Anthony's framework and list of resources for the course he teaches on the masculine journey</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Anthony Bradley</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.dranthonybradley.com/" target="_blank">Anthony's website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/07/71NOk5RQZgL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
