<p>With over 14.5 million subscribers, Rosanna Pansino has one of the most popular baking channels on YouTube&nbsp;But she never would have imagined her success back in 2010 when she started making videos as a hobby. At the time, she was a working actor in Hollywood with dreams of landing a leading role, but after receiving an ultimatum from her agent, she was forced to choose between a career in traditional television or the nascent digital world of YouTube. More than a decade after her fateful choice, Rosanna has come full circle with her dreams in entertainment as she hosts her own shows on The Food Network â€” while continuing to post on YouTube and adding to her catalog of over 1,400 videos with more than 4.7 billion views.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Carla Esteves, with music by Ramtin Arablouei</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant and Casey Herman, with research help from Melia Agudelo.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on <a href="https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>X</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at <em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>
