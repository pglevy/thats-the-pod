<p>Friendships are a central part of the lives of both men and women. But from personal observation, you've probably noticed that the dynamics of male and female friendships aren't always the same. You may not, however, have been able to articulate what those differences are or have known what's behind them.</p><p>While there's still a lot of facets of friendship that haven't yet been researched, Dr. Jaimie Krems, who runs UCLA's Social Minds Lab, has a lot of interesting insights about what we do know about how and why men and women approach friendship differently. Today on the show, she explains why men and women form friendships and the differences in the size and nature of their social circles, how long their friendships last, and what they look for in friends. We also discuss why men have a greater tolerance for their friends' flaws than women do, why men and women would want to be friends with each other, and how each sex experiences friendship jealousy.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://michaelshermer.com/articles/the-bankers-paradox/" target="_blank">The Banker's Paradox</a></li><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23950081_Males'_Greater_Tolerance_of_Same-Sex_Peers" target="_blank">Joyce Benenson's research on "Males' Greater Tolerance of Same-Sex Peers"</a></li><li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1335368/full" target="_blank">Jaimie's research on women's interpretation of disgust faces</a></li><li><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspi0000311" target="_blank">Jaimie's study: "Friendship Jealousy: One Tool for Maintaining Friendships in the Face of Third-Party Threats?"</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/podcast-229-how-men-and-women-socialize-differently/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #229: How Men and Women Socialize Differently</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/understanding-male-friendships/" target="_blank">AoMPodcast #360: Understanding Male Friendships</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/male-friendship-recession/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #726: What’s Causing the Male Friendship Recession?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/how-long-does-it-take-to-make-friends-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #772: How Long Does It Take to Make Friends (And How Does That Process Work, Anyway)?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/how-not-to-be-disappointed-with-your-friends/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How Not to Be Disappointed With Your Friends</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Jaimie Krems</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.kremslab.com/" target="_blank">The Social Minds Lab at UCLA</a></li><li><a href="https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/jkrems/" target="_blank">Jaimie's faculty page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/jkrems/" target="_blank">Jaimie on X</a></li></ul>
