<p>As compared to mothers, fathers are sometimes thought of as a secondary, almost superfluous, parent.</p><p>But my guest says that fathers actually saved the human race, and continue to do so today.</p><p>Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist, a pioneer of fatherhood science, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3RnMneH"><i>Life Of Dad</i></a>. Today on the show, we talk about the role of fathers in human history and how their main role continues to be teaching kids the skills they need to take risks, become independent, and navigate the world beyond their family. We also talk about the physiological changes that happen when a man becomes a father and how dads are just as biologically primed as mothers to parent. In the second half of our conversation, we talk about the experience of being a dad. Anna shares how long it typically takes a man to bond with a baby and transition into the role of fatherhood, how roughhousing is key in building that bond as well as developing your child's resilience, and how your personality and background will affect your parenting. We end our conversation with the difference in how the relationship between Mom and Dad affects how they parent, and the implications of that for building a strong family.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/the-importance-of-fathers-according-to-science/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Importance of Fathers (According to Science)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/a-mans-guide-to-pregnancy-getting-ready-for-the-baby-bomb/" target="_blank">AoM Article: A Man’s Guide to Pregnancy — Getting Ready for the Baby Bomb</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/a-mans-guide-to-pregnancy-your-progeny-enters-the-world/" target="_blank">AoM Article: A Man’s Guide to Pregnancy — Your Progeny Enters the World</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/new-dad-survival-guide-the-mindset/" target="_blank">AoM Article:New Dad Survival Guide — The Mindset</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/new-dad-survival-guide-the-skillset/" target="_blank">AoM Article: New Dad Survival Guide — The Skillset</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/podcast-do-fathers-matter/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #119: Why Fathers Matter </a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/fatherhood/you-dont-have-to-be-your-dad-how-to-become-your-familys-transitional-character/" target="_blank">AoM Article: You Don’t Have to Be Your Dad — How to Become Your Family’s Transitional Character</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Anna Machin</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://annamachin.com/" target="_blank">Anna's website</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/dr_aMachin" target="_blank">Anna on X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_amachin/" target="_blank">Anna on IG</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/06/71ng8lNwqLL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
