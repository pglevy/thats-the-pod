<p>We kick off Season 11 with the incredible story of the retail “granddaddy of them all” Walmart, and its founder Sam Walton. Once you study Walmart, you realize just how deep its heritage runs through Amazon and so many iconic modern companies we cover on Acquired. This episode was an absolute blast, and we even uncovered a new addendum to the hallowed “focus on what makes your beer taste better” playbook theme! </p><p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our newly public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!).<br></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p> Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/056532643/files/doc_financials/1970s/1972-annual-report-for-walmart-stores-inc.pdf"> Walmart’s 1972 Annual Report</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQdMwaXEZ9H0ptdzl_oKWER06O5A38qjr7eeglrJGhc/edit?usp=sharing"> Episode sources</a></li></ul><p> Carve Outs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://iamhome.libsyn.com/lunch-with-warren-buffett-working-for-berkshire-hathaway-and-the-future-of-investments-with-ted-weschler"> Ted Weschler on the Nebraska Furniture Mart podcast!!!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Godfather-Mario-Puzo-dp-0451205766/dp/0451205766/"> Mario Puzo’s The Godfather (the book)</a></li></ul><p><em>‍ Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
