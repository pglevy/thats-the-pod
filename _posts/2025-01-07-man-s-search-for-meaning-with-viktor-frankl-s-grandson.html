<p>I first read <a href="https://amzn.to/40jRNMC"><i>Man's Search for Meaning</i></a> by the neurologist, psychologist, and philosopher Viktor Frankl in high school, and I have re-read it several times since. It's one of the books that's had the biggest impact on my life, so it was a real treat to speak with Alexander Vesely, Frankl's grandson, about his grandfather's ideas and legacy.</p><p>Today on the show, I talk to Alexander, who is a documentarian, and like his grandfather, a psychotherapist, about Frankl's life, his development of logotherapy, a type of meaning-centered therapy, and how that approach to the psyche was tested during Frankl's time in the concentration camps. We discuss why Frankl said that "everyone has their own Auschwitz," how a lack of existential meaning can create depression, the three ways to actualize meaning in your life, whether meaning is something that is objective or subjective, the freedom we have to choose our attitude in all circumstances, including suffering, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4gAGyVK" target="_blank"><i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> by Viktor Frankl</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3BSogAg" target="_blank"><i>The Doctor and the Soul</i> by Viktor Frankl</a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/viktorandi" target="_blank"><i>Viktor and I: The Life and Work of Viktor Frankl</i> — Alexander's documentary about his grandfather</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/422bOZr" target="_blank"><i>Living Logotherapy</i> by Elisabeth Lukas and Heidi Schönfeld</a></li><li><a href="https://logotherapy-online.com/" target="_blank"> Logotherapy Online Academy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.viktorfranklinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Viktor Frankl Institute </a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Alexander Vesely</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.viktorfranklinstitute.org/personnel/alex-vesley/" target="_blank">Alexander at the Viktor Frankl Institute</a></li><li><a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/alexander-vesely-70311228" target="_blank">Alexander on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_d_vesely/" target="_blank">Alexander on IG</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2025/01/81UhnGT7BvL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Book cover of "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor E.
