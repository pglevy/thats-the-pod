<p>Board games have long been a source of social activity and family entertainment. But my guest today makes the case that board games can be more than just a way to while away the time, and can also offer insights about relationships, decision making, and the changing currents of culture. His name is <a href="http://twitter.com/jonkay">Jonathan Kay</a> and he's a co-author of the book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WJHSGCK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07WJHSGCK&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">Your Move: What Board Games Teach Us About Life</a>. </em>We begin our conversation discussing the board game renaissance that has taken place in the past twenty years and how today's board games are much more nuanced, complex, and arguably more fun than the classic games you probably played as a kid. Jonathan and I then discuss how the evolution of the board game <em>Life </em>can give us insights into our culture's changing ideas of virtue and how board games often reflect the attitudes of a given time. We then discuss what cooperative games like <em>Pandemic</em> tell us about how to handle overbearing people and how the game <em>Dead of Winter </em>highlights the way private interests often conflict with group interests. Jonathan then shares why <em>Monopoly</em> is such a divisive game and whether board games can teach resilience. At the end of the show, Jonathan gives his personal recommendations for board games to check out that are way better than the chutes and ladders type games you played growing up.</p>
