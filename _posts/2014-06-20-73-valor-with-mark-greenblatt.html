<p>I talk to to author Mark Greenblatt about his book Valor: Unsung Heroes from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Homefront. We discuss why the American public know so little about heroes from the most recent wars, stories about the brave men he features in this book, and lessons we can take from them on being better men.</p>
