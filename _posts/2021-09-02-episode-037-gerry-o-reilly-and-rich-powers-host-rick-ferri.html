<p>Gerry O'Reilly is the manager of the $1.3 trillion <a href='https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax'>Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund</a> and ETF, and Rich Powers is the Head of ETF and Index Product Management at Vanguard. In this fascinating interview, we go behind the scenes to learn how the largest mutual fund in the world operates. Our discussion covers trading the mammoth fund - including tricky microcap stocks, fund fees and expenses, security lending, proxy voting, tax efficiency, cash management, in-kind additions and distributions, and a lot more! </p>
