<p>We’re joined by the legendary Nolan Bushnell, founder not only of Atari, but also the only person ever to hire Steve Jobs, the recipient of Sequoia Capital’s first-ever investment, and the creator of Chuck E. Cheese, the canonical GPS navigation arrow, and a little project that would go on to become Pixar. We cover it all in this special episode!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Links:</p><ul><li>Spacewar!, the first video game: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!</a> </li><li>The meaning of Atari: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atari">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atari</a></li><li>Nolan’s current project, St. Noire: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/St-Noire-Hosted-Cinematic-Exclusive/dp/B07P693BG1"> https://www.amazon.com/St-Noire-Hosted-Cinematic-Exclusive/dp/B07P693BG1</a></li></ul>
