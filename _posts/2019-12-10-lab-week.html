<p>Get out your Bunsen burner! It&apos;s time to do some experiments. In this episode, we talk to two businesses that aren&apos;t afraid to try new things. First, the three founders of The Mad Optimist, a soap company in Indiana, talk about letting customers choose what they pay for their products. Then Natalie Nagele, the co-founder and CEO of software company Wildbit, talks about an ongoing experiment with four-day work weeks and what she&apos;s discovered about productivity, happiness, and deep work.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p>The Mad Optimist <a href='https://www.themadoptimist.com/'>website</a> | <a href='https://www.facebook.com/TheMadOptimist/'>Facebook</a> | <a href='https://www.instagram.com/themadoptimist/'>Instagram</a> - 00:45</p><p>You can find The Mad Optimist&apos;s live revenue number <a href='https://www.themadoptimist.com/humanifesto'>in their Humanifesto</a> under &quot;We practice radical transparency&quot; - 9:43</p><p>Natalie Nagele <a href='https://twitter.com/natalienagele/'>on Twitter</a> - 16:51</p><p>Wildbit <a href='https://wildbit.com/'>website</a> - 16:53</p><p>Basecamp&apos;s entry on <a href='https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md#summer-hours'>Summer Hours</a> in the company handbook - 16:57</p><p><a href='https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/'>Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport - 18:54<br/></p>
