<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3CugBCO">The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!) Story of Albert D. Lasker and the Creation of the Advertising Century</a> by Jeffrey L. Cruikshank and Arthur W. Schultz.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----<br /><br />Advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words: Salesmanship in print.<br /><br />Before he arrived on the scene, advertising agencies were mostly brokers of space in newspapers and magazines.

Lasker felt sure that he could build the business, and boost commissions if he could improve the agency's copywriting.<br /><br />You are insufferably egotistical on the things you know nothing about, and you are painfully modest about those things about which you know everything.<br /><br />Hopkins began imparting his theory of copywriting. We should never brag about a client's product, he said, or plead with consumers to buy it. Instead, we must figure out how to appeal to the consumer's self-interest.<br /><br />Lasker argued that rather than maintaining many modestly successful small brands, the company needed to create one overwhelmingly powerful product.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
