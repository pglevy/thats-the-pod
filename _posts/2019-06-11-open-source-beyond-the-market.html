<p>This is a lightly edited version of a keynote address Basecamp co-founder and CTO David Heinemeier Hansson delivered at RailsConf 2019 about &quot;open source, markets, debts, purpose, and no less than the meaning of life.&quot; David also sits down with Shaun to talk briefly about how he approached this keynote differently than past talks.</p>
