<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, joined by movement and parkour expert Rafe Kelley, discuss the importance of rough-and-tumble play for developing children, how a lifestyle centered around movement can expand our grasp and involvement with the natural world, and why society should value masculine activities, rather than adhering to the push for feminization in all aspects of modern life.</p><p> </p><p>Rafe Kelley is an entrepreneur and advocate for a lifestyle centered around human movement. He suffered at a young age from ADHD, causing him to struggle in school. As it would happen, he came into contact with a mentor who recognized his need for play, encouraged time in nature, and taught him to productively roughhouse. This quickly resulted in Kelley advancing in his studies, launching him on his life path. In college, he studied anthropology and evolutionary biology, falling in love with martial arts and parkour along the way. He would go on to establish the first parkour gym on the west coast, Parkour Visions, before developing a new fitness lifestyle based on primal movement that Kelley calls “Evolve, Move, Play.”</p><p> </p><p>- Sponsors -</p><p> </p><p>Birch Gold Group: Text "JORDAN" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.</p><p> </p><p>Hallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Rafe Kelley:</p><p> </p><p>Join Rafe on an Evolve Move Play retreat: https://www.evolvemoveplay.com/retreats/</p><p> </p><p>Rafe on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rafekelley/?hl=en</p><p> </p><p>Rafe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/rafekelley </p>
