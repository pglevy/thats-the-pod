<p>Basecamp is a remote company, so we&apos;re less disrupted by the current pandemic than many other businesses, but we&apos;re still taking steps to keep folks safe. Jason Fried talks about canceling the company&apos;s April meetup and closing the Chicago office. Rework will be taking a few weeks off so we can get set up with recording studios at home. In the meantime, if you&apos;re working from home for the first time, we&apos;d love to hear your stories! Please get in touch at hello@rework.fm (you can write an email or send us a voice memo) or leave us a voicemail at 708-628-7850.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWU4F7RHhn0'>Tearing the heart out of Saturday night</a> - 00:06</p><p>Joe Bob Briggs&apos; series, <a href='https://www.shudder.com/series/watch/the-last-drive-in-july-2018-marathon/f4e5e0c17cf7a0ee?season=1'>The Last Drive-In</a> - 0:14</p><p><a href='https://musicboxtheatre.com/films/joe-bob-briggs-how-rednecks-saved-hollywood'>Joe Bob Briggs: How Rednecks Saved Hollywood</a> - 00:27</p><p><a href='https://rework.fm/you-never-forget-george-pappageorge/'>Our recent episode</a> about leaving the Chicago office - 1:10</p><p><a href='https://railsconf.com/'>RailsConf</a> - 5:59</p><p><a href='https://thedistance.com'>The Distance</a> - 8:57</p><p>Wailin learned about fomites from <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/04/hands-across-america'>this 2013 New Yorker article</a> and now she won&apos;t stop talking about them - 10:46</p>
