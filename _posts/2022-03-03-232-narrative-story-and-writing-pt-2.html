In this second part, we look at what it means to write with purpose and what that ability can add to your life.</p><p>We also look into how reading and writing connects to personal growth, and how character is built by forcing an articulation of what we think, how we feel, and why.</p><p>This compilation consists of conversations from season 4 with people like Randall Wallace, Jocko Willink, and Andrew Doyle. There's also a section from Mikhaila Peterson podcast, episode 54 with Jordan and Mark Manson.</p><p> </p>
