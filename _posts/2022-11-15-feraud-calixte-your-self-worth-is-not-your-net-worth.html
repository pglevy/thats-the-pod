<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Feraud Calixte. Feraud is the founder and lead financial planner of Vantage Pointe Planning, which is a fee-only financial planning firm based in Burlington, North Carolina. He started Vantage Pointe in order to serve clients who weren’t being served by the traditional models for financial advice, especially those who don’t meet an asset minimum and business owners with a lot of their net worth tied up in their firms. Before starting Vantage Pointe, Feraud worked as an advisor for several large wealth management firms. He currently serves as a national board member for the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, and he also frequently teaches financial literacy courses. <i>Investment News</i> named Feraud to its 40 under 40 list of financial advisors under the age of 40. He earned his undergraduate degree from New York University and his law degree from Southern University Law Center. He is also a CFP certificant.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://vantagepointeplanning.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://40under40inadvice.com/winners/feraud-calixte/" target="_blank">Investment News 40 Under 40: Feraud Calixte</a></p><p>“<a href="https://www.burlingtonnc.gov/2378/Business-Spotlight-5---Feraud-Calixte" target="_blank">Business Spotlight #5—Feraud Calixte</a>,” City of Burlington, Economic Development Department, <a href="http://burlingtonnc.gov.com/" target="_blank">burlingtonnc.gov.com</a>, Jan. 6, 2022.</p><p>Financial Education and Advice</p><p><a href="https://www.nobcche.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers</a> (NOBCChE)</p><p>“<a href="https://www.investmentnews.com/financial-education-to-stoke-wealth-creation-for-diverse-groups-76106" target="_blank">Financial Education to Stoke Wealth Creation for Diverse Groups</a>,” by Bloomberg, <a href="http://investmentnews.com/" target="_blank">investmentnews.com</a>, Sept. 18, 2018.</p><p>“<a href="https://feraudcalixte.substack.com/p/blue-ocean" target="_blank">Blue Ocean: The Future Is Bright for Financial Planners</a>,” by Feraud Calixte, <a href="http://feraudcalixte.substack.com/" target="_blank">feraudcalixte.substack.com</a>, Nov. 12, 2021.</p><p>Current Environment</p><p>“<a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-difference-between-bonds-and-bond-funds-2466581" target="_blank">Bonds vs. Bond Funds: What’s the Difference?</a>” by Kent Thune, <a href="http://thebalancemoney.com/" target="_blank">thebalancemoney.com</a>, April 26, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1088780/should-you-invest-in-individual-bonds-or-bond-funds-today" target="_blank">Should You Invest in Individual Bonds or Bond Funds Today?</a>” by Christine Benz and Susan Dziubinski, <a href="http://morningstar.com/" target="_blank">Morningstar.com</a>, April 20, 2022.</p><p>Other</p><p><a href="https://www.garrettplanningnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Garrett Planning Network</a></p><p><a href="https://www.napfa.org/" target="_blank">NAPFA</a></p>
