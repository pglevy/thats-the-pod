<p>My two guests are James Dahle, MD, a practicing emergency physician, founder of The White Coat Investor, and the creator of the "No Hype Real Estate Investing" course, and John Worth, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research and Investor Outreach at Nareit. Our topic in the episode is real estate investing. We cover the spectrum of real estate investment opportunities, from flipping homes to listed real estate investment trusts (REITs).</p>
