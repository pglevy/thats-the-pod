<p>We’re hitting pause on new episodes during this holiday week. But we wanted to resurface one of our favorite conversations of the past year—the one that Jeff Ptak and I had with author and longtime columnist Scott Burns. We hope that you’ll enjoy it, and we’ll be back with a fresh episode next week.</p><p>Our guest on the podcast today is syndicated personal finance columnist and author, Scott Burns. Scott began his career as a newspaper columnist in <i>The Boston Herald</i> in 1977, where he was also the financial editor. In 1985, he joined the staff of <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>, where his column became one of the most widely read features in the paper. Along the way, he created what he called Couch Potato Investing, which involves buying and holding a broadly diversified portfolio of low-cost index mutual funds. Scott has authored or co-authored several books, including <i>The Coming Generational Storm</i> and <i>Spend ‘Til the End</i>, both of which he co-authored with Laurence Kotlikoff. He received bachelor’s degrees in humanities and biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-burns-75598712/">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://scottburns.com/category/couch-potato-investing/">Couch Potato Investing</a></p><p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262612081/the-coming-generational-storm/"><i>The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know About America’s Economic Future</i></a>, by Laurence J.
