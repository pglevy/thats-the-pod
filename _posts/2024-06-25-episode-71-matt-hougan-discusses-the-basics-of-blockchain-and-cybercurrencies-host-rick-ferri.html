<p>Matt Hougan is the Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds with more than $4 billion in assets under management. Before joining Bitwise, Matt held several notable positions in the financial industry, including CEO at Inside ETFs, Managing Director of Global Finance at Informa, and CEO of ETF.com. Matt also co-authored The CFA Institute's publication on ETFs, "A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Matt is a long-time Boglehead who attended the Bogleheads Conference in years past. I asked him to join me for a no-spin discussion about cyber-currencies. We cover the history of blockchain technology, why cryptology is important to the blockchain, and how this led to Bitcoin, the world's first digital currency, and eventually other digital currencies, including the digital dollar. The discussion is structured as purely educational. There is no sales hype, no recommendations for purchase or sale, and no price speculation. </p>

<p>The Bogleheads on Investing podcast is hosted by <a href='https://rickferri.com/'>Rick Ferri, CFA</a>, a long-time Boglehead and investment adviser. <a href='https://www.boglecenter.net/'>The Bogleheads</a> are a group of like-minded individual investors who follow the general investment and business beliefs of John C.
