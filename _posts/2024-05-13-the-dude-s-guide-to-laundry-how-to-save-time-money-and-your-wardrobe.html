<p>If you didn’t grow up doing your own laundry, once you headed out on your own, you probably just figured things out on the fly, hoped for the best, and have been doing things the same way ever since. But, while you may be getting the job done okay, you also might be making some mistakes that are costing you time, money, and cleaner clothes.</p><p>In this episode from the Art of Manliness department of essential life skills, we’ll cover all the things you should have learned as a young man but never did, and how to do your laundry effectively. Our guide is Patric Richardson, aka the “Laundry Evangelist,” a laundry expert who runs how-to-do-laundry camps, hosts the television show The Laundry Guy, and is the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4bybfYQ"><i>Laundry Love</i></a>. Today on the show, Patric shares the one cycle and water temperature you should use for all of your clothes, exactly how much detergent you should be using (which is a lot less than you think), how often you should wash your clothes (which is less often than you think), why you shouldn’t ever use dryer sheets (and what to throw in your dryer instead), how regardless of what the tag says, you can wash anything at home (including a wool suit), how to easily get rid of stains (including yellow pit stains), and many more tips that will save you time, money, and hassle in doing your laundry.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/how-to/how-to-do-laundry/">AoM Article: How to Do Laundry</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/the-simplifying-step-missing-from-your-laundry-routine/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Simplifying Step Missing From Your Laundry Routine</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/clothing/how-many-times-you-can-wear-your-clothes-between-washes/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How Many Times You Can Wear Your Clothes Between Washes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/clothing/how-to-get-the-stink-out-of-workout-shirts/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Get the Stink Out of Synthetic Workout Shirts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/how-to-remove-yellow-armpit-stains/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Remove and Prevent Yellow Armpit Stains</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/clothing/a-guide-to-shrinking-levis-501-shrink-to-fit-jeans/" target="_blank">AoM Article: A Guide to Shrinking Levi’s 501 Shrink-to-Fit Jeans</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Patric Richardson</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://laundryevangelist.com/" target="_blank">Patric’s website </a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvanK5Yvt2pIgbNZt3DqIXQ" target="_blank">Patric on YouTube</a></li></ul>
