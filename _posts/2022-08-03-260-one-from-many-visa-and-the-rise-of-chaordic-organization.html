<p>What I learned from rereading <a href="https://amzn.to/3BDB8Yd">One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization</a> by Dee Hock. </p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>[2:00] I feel compelled to open my life to new possibilities.</p><p>[2:54] Life is a magnificent, mysterious Odyssey to be experienced.</p><p>[3:12] <a href="https://amzn.to/3OZvW42" target="_blank">One From Many</a> (Founders #42)</p><p>[3:30] <a href="https://amzn.to/3vwePjq" target="_blank">Autobiography of a Restless Mind: Reflections on the Human Condition Volume 1</a> by Dee Hock and <a href="https://amzn.to/3PU5ZUY" target="_blank">Autobiography of a Restless Mind: Reflections on the Human Condition Volume 2</a> by Dee Hock</p><p>[5:12] <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1550546772023357441?s=20&t=gvpyJNB9QUD6e3smf-bEyg" target="_blank">Patrick Collison tweet on Dee Hock</a></p><p>[7:51] He thought from first principles and questioned everything, even down to the nature of money itself.</p><p>[8:26] He saw a better way of doing things and he didn't listen to folks who said it couldn't be done.</p><p>[9:32] Today's magic was yesterday's dream.</p><p>[13:27] Chaordic 1. The behavior of any self-organizing, self-governing, organ, organization, or system that harmoniously exhibits characteristics of both order and chaos.   2.  Patterned by chaos and order in a way not dominated by either.  3.  Blending of diversity, chaos, complexity and order characteristic of the fundamental organizing principles of evolution and nature.</p><p>[17:05] <strong>That Hock boy is a little strange, he'll read anything</strong>.</p><p>[23:01]  None of it seemed demeaning. It was life. It was making a living. It was what proud men did without whining.</p><p>[24:14] 76 year old Dee Hock describing the 20 year old version of Dee Hock: Thus, at twenty, newly married, unemployed, eager to learn but averse to being taught, emerged an absurdly naive, idealistic, young man—an innocent lamb hunting the lion of life. The hungry lion was swift to pounce.</p><p>[30:39] If you don’t zero in on your bureaucracy every so often, you will naturally build in layers. You never set out to add bureaucracy. You just get it. Period. Without even knowing it. So you always have to be looking to eliminate it. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3C3v35B" target="_blank">Sam Walton: Made In America</a> by Sam Walton (Founders #234)</p><p>[31:57] In industrial age organizations purpose slowly erodes into process.</p><p>[34:29] Excellence is the capacity to take pain.</p><p>[38:41] You can't make a good deal with a bad person.</p><p>[39:48] Stubborn opinionated, unorthodox, rebellious.</p><p>[41:31] With three young children, a heavily mortgaged house, no job, little money in reserve, it was impossible to stay out of a dismal swamp of depression. Day after day, I walked the woods in misting Northwest rain. My constant companion was an overwhelming feeling of failure. What was wrong with me?</p><p>[42:51] There would be no more intense commitment to work.</p><p>[43:55] He's got an intense commitment to life!</p><p>[45:38] Use your brain but follow your heart.</p><p>[53:52] When I die and go to hell, the devil is going to make me the marketing director for a cola company. I’ll be in charge of trying to sell a product that no one needs, is identical to its competition, and can’t be sold on its merits. I’d be competing head-on in the cola wars, on price, distribution, advertising, and promotion, which would indeed be hell for me. — <a href="https://amzn.to/2vA44hh" target="_blank">Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman</a> by Yvon Chouinard (Founders #18)</p><p>[55:56] Focus on how your product or company ought to be and nothing else.</p><p>[57:28] <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/46164128/rampell-visa-the-original-protocol-business?tab=transcript" target="_blank">Business Breakdowns Visa: The Original Protocol Business</a></p><p>[58:10] <a href="https://amzn.to/2Q5r4Cg" target="_blank">Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary</a> by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond (Founders #176)</p><p>[1:02:40] His Oh Shit! Moment</p><p>[1:06:12] <strong>He had a passionate commitment to the ideas that bordered on zealotry.</strong></p><p>[1:06:39] There were dozens of times when I longed to quit. What prevented me is not entirely clear.</p><p>[1:06:58] Possibility can never be determined by opinion, only by attempt.</p><p>[1:07:26] What kept me going remains a mystery. It doesn't really matter for there was an inexpressible sense that in some profound non-physical way existence would lose meaning if I did not persist.</p><p>[1:10:03] <a href="https://amzn.to/3owTTFi" target="_blank">Chronicles: Volume One</a> by Bob Dylan (Founders #259)</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes.com</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
