<p>Learn How to Make Good Work AND Please Your Clients — Take The Six Stages of Illustration: <a href="https://skl.sh/4cCTxEH">https://skl.sh/4cCTxEH</a> — Use this link to get 30 days of free membership on Skillshare.</p><p>What makes otherwise good people such bad clients? How do you deal with them — and how can you avoid them in the first place? In this episode, I explain why there almost never truly bad clients. In my 10+ year career, I've had very few bad clients. Most of them were in the beginning, when I didn't have enough experience to spot them before it's too late. By listening to this episode, you'll learn what I wish I knew when I was starting out — and this will help you make sure every client is a good client! That means they'll trust you to do what you do best (the art!) and they'll give you everything you need to do your job.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend.</strong></p><p>This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at </strong><a href="http://patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>http://patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a></p><ul><li>$8 Drawing Buddies gain exclusive access to my monthly Draw With Me meetups.</li><li>Join for as low as $3 to get 20% off my 1-on-1 coaching sessions</li></ul><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes!</strong></p><ul><li>Visit <a href="http://www.tomfroese.com/teaching">http://tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
