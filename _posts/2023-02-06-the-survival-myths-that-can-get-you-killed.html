<p>Surviving in the wild can seem like a romantic proposition, at least as it often plays out in popular culture and our imagination. We picture ourselves confidently navigating the obstacles of nature, pulling trout out of mountain streams, and building a snug shelter inside a tree.</p><p>But the reality of wilderness survival isn't so rosy. Few people know that better than Jim Baird. Jim and his brother won the fourth season of <i>Alone</i>, a reality show that's actually real, and leaves contestants in the wild to face the elements and live off the land. Today on the podcast, Jim shares his experiences surviving on Northern Vancouver Island for 75 days, and what he learned from them as to what's true about survival and what's simply a myth.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.history.com/shows/alone/season-4" target="_blank">Season 4 of<i> Alone</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.fieldandstream.com/story/survival/survival-myths-that-can-get-you-killed/" target="_blank"><i>"</i>Four Survival Myths That Could Get You Killed" — <i>Field and Stream</i> article by Jim</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/outdoor-survival/podcast-848-the-5-priorities-of-short-term-survival/" target="_blank">AoMPodcast #848: The 5 Priorities of Short-Term Survival</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Jim Baird</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JimBairdAdventurer" target="_blank">Jim on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jbadventurer/" target="_blank">Jim on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jbadventurer/" target="_blank">Jim on FB</a></li></ul><h2> </h2>
