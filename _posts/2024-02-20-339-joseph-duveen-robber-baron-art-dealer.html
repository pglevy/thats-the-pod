Take a simple, basic idea and </p><p>2. Take it very seriously. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gx5sFn">the NEW Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charlie Munger</a>. (Founders #329)</p><p>(10:00) The art dealer Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare as possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he sold became more than just paintings—they were fetish objects, their value increased by their rarity.  — <a href="https://amzn.to/3I5Zs77">The 48 Laws of Power</a> by Robert Greene. </p><p>(14:00) Duveen had enormous respect for the prices he set on the objects he bought and sold.

Duveen was that kind of man.</p><p>(32:00) Monopoly was his method.</p><p>(38:00) Duveen would pay the servants of staff that worked in the homes of his clients. This was the result: They developed a feeling that it was only fair to transmit to Duveen any information that might interest him.</p><p>(41:00) The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible problem.</p><p>The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen’s paintings were running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it seemed unlikely that they would keep buying.</p><p>The solution was the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery was the perfect front for Duveen.</p><p>In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices.
