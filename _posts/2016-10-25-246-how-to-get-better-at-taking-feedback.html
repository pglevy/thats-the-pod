<p>Knowing how to give and receive feedback is essential for our personal and professional growth. To remedy the discomfort we have with it, most books and articles focus on how the giver of feedback can take the sting out of its delivery with tactics like the ever-popular &quot;criticism sandwich.&quot; But Doug Stone argues in his latest book that when it comes to feedback, we should be focusing on how we can be better receivers of it.<br />Stone is the co-author of the book &quot;Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well&quot; and today he joins me on the show to discuss why even constructive criticism is so hard to take, as well as brass-tacks advice on how you can be less defensive and more open to the feedback you receive on a daily basis. You’ll want to take notes on this episode. It’s crammed with information that can improve your life immediately.</p>
