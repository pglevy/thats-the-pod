<p>They say that manners make the man. But how do you display good manners without coming off as awkward and in a way that elevates life both for yourself and for others? Today I bring back writer David Coggins to discuss etiquette and manners in the modern age. <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-282-man-develops-sense-style/" target="_blank">I had David on the show a year ago to discuss his book <em>Men and Style</em></a>.

We end our conversation highlighting the grace and power of handwritten notes.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/menandmanners" target="_blank">aom.is/menandmanners</a>.</p>
