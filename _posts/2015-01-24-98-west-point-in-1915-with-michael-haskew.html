<p>West Point's graduating class of 1915 produced some of America's greatest military leaders including Eisenhower and Omar Bradley. Author and historian Michael Haskew calls it &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot;. In today's podcast I talk to Michael about his book West Point 1915 and the men who made up this class and what made them so special.</p>
