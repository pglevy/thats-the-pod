<p>Between 1991 and 1996, Jim and Jamie Dutcher lived with and filmed a pack of wolves in Idaho. From this intensive field work came the award-winning documentary, &quot;Wolves at Our Door.&quot; The husband and wife team are out with a new book that highlights some of the things they learned on living a flourishing life from the wolf pack they were embedded within. It’s called &quot;The Wisdom of Wolves: Lessons from the Sawtooth Pack.&quot;<br />Jim and Jamie share what wolves can teach us about family, respecting your elders, play, the importance of belonging to a group, leadership, and what it really means to be an alpha wolf. Tune in for a fascinating conversation on a fascinating creature that has much to teach us humans.<br />Get the full show notes at aom.is/wisdomofwolves.</p>
