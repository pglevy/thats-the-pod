<p>What can we learn about emotional resilience from Plutarch’s classic <em>On Peace of Mind</em>?  Practical advice from Plutarch on putting values into action, cognitive distancing, cultivating gratitude, and more.</p><p>This is the full audio recording of Donald’s presentation from the Plato’s Academy Centre Philosophy and Resilience event on 20th May 2023.  As there were some glitches with the streaming software, Donald re-recorded the <em>whole</em> presentation and the sound has been edited and quality improved.  The recording also includes Lalya Lloyd’s reading of a passage from Plutarch, which contains a verse from Euripides’ lost tragedy, <em>Bellerophon</em>, read by Lalya in ancient Greek. </p><p><p>Plato's Academy Centre Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.
