<p>This episode was recorded on April 4, 2022.</p><p><br /></p><p>In this speech at the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Jordan shared recent thoughts on ethics, scripture, and the problem of perception. He asked the audience to reflect on how we remember great stories (but seem to instantly forget bad ones), why Western culture ended up being a book (instead of—say—a sickle), and whether the West truly is a “phallogocentric" culture.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of this, Jordan says, tied to a broader possibility—perhaps his “most radical claim"—that, as we navigate the value structures we call reality, a lot of so-called “navigational” problems are really veiled ethical ones.</p><p><br /></p><p>#Perception #Bible #Western #Power #Literature #Ethics</p><p> </p>
