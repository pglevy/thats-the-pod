Ever wonder who owns all the internet domains like .com, .co, all the way to goofy domain names like .george and .plumbing? Well it turns out, many of these are owned by billionaires & big companies. Our hero today - Sheel Mohnot (@pitdesi) created an online auction site (like Ebay, but instead of selling beanie babies, he auctions off internet real estate). He has hosted $100M+ worth of auctions, keeping a 4% cut for himself along the way. Hear how he found this wacky niche, got the auction platform off the ground - and how he went from living on $1/day in India to becoming a self-made millionaire.Â
