<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Marc Freedman. He is the co-CEO and founder of <a href="http://encore.org/" target="_blank">Encore.org</a>, which is now known as CoGenerate and is geared toward helping people pursue meaningful work later in life. Freedman is also the author of <i>How to Live Forever: The Enduring Power of Connecting the Generations</i>. He co-founded Experience Corps to mobilize people over 50 to improve the school performance and prospects of low-income elementary school students in 22 U.S. cities. Freedman also spearheaded the creation of the Encore Fellowships program, a one-year fellowship helping individuals translate their midlife skills into second acts focused on social impact, and the Purpose Prize, an annual $100,000 prize for social entrepreneurs in the second half of life. Freedman received his bachelor’s degree from Swarthmore College and his Master of Business Administration from the Yale School of Management.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://encore.org/marc-freedman-bios/">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://cogenerate.org/">CoGenerate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.aarp.org/experience-corps/">Experience Corps</a></p><p><a href="https://cogenerate.org/how-to-live-forever/"><i>How to Live Forever: The Enduring Power of Connecting the Generations</i></a><i>, </i>by Marc Freedman</p><p>Age Diversity</p><p>“<a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/overcoming_age_segregation">Overcoming Age Segregation</a>,” by Marc Freedman and Trent Stamp, <i>Stanford Social Innovation Review</i>, March 15, 2021.</p><p>“<a href="https://workingnation.com/will-2023-be-the-year-that-we-begin-to-make-the-most-of-age-diversity-in-the-workplace/">Will 2023 Be the Year That We Begin to Make the Most of Age Diversity in the Workplace?</a>” by Ramona Schindelheim, WorkingNation, Dec. 27, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.templeton.org/news/harnessing-the-power-of-age-diversity">Harnessing the Power of Age Diversity</a>,” by Alene Dawson, John Templeton Foundation, Oct. 31, 2023.</p><p>“<a href="https://workingnation.com/america-is-arguably-the-most-age-diverse-society-in-human-history-its-high-time-to-prepare-for-our-increasingly-multigenerational-workforce/">America Is Arguably the Most Age-Diverse Society in Human History—It’s High Time to Prepare for Our Increasingly Multigenerational Workforce</a>,” by Ramona Shindelheim, WorkingNation, Dec. 10, 2023.</p><p>Encore Careers</p><p>“<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/encore-career.asp">Encore Career: What It Is, How It Works, Prevalence</a>,” by Julia Kagan, Investopedia, Jan. 16, 2022.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Encore-Finding-Work-Matters-Second/dp/1586486349"><i>Encore: Finding Work That Matters in the Second Half of Life</i></a>, by Marc Freedman</p><p>“<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/case-putting-seniors-charge-universal-pre-k-opinion-1654236">The Case for Putting Seniors in Charge of Universal Pre-K | Opinion</a>,” by Marc Freedman and Carol Larson, <i>Newsweek</i>, Nov. 29, 2021.</p><p><a href="https://encore.org/the-purpose-prize/">The Purpose Prize</a></p><p>Work/Life Across Generations</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/kerry-hannon-remote-work-trend-benefits-older-workers">Kerry Hannon: Remote Work Trend Benefits Older Workers</a>,” <i>The Long View</i> podcast, Morningstar, Oct. 20, 2020.</p><p>“<a href="https://cogenerate.org/research/cogeneration/">Is America Ready to Unleash a Multigenerational Force for Good?</a>” A National Opinion Survey From <a href="http://encore.org/" target="_blank">Encore.org</a> With NORC at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Other</p><p>“<a href="https://hbr.org/2010/03/the-globe-how-bmw-is-defusing-the-demographic-time-bomb">The Globe: How BMW Is Diffusing the Demographic Time Bomb</a>,” by Christoph Loch, Fabian J.
