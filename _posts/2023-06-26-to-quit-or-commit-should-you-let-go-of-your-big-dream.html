<p><strong>IS IT TIME TO LEAN IN OR LET GO? </strong>When is it time to double down and commit to that thing you said you’d do, and when might it be time to call it quits? As illustrators and creative people, we may have all kinds of things we think we should be doing, whether to build up our careers or grow in our skills, or using our art for some kind of good. If you’re at the very beginning of your career, or barely even getting started at this point, you may well be wondering, how long is this thing going to take before I start getting noticed? How do I know if all this work I’m pouring into this thing is going to pay off? For a lot of us, I know we’re also trying to get noticed on social media. We wonder how much effort should we be putting into building our presence online and, more to my point, if we’re not seeing the returns we hoped for, when might it be time to quit altogether?</p><p>In this episode, I’m going to share with you some times when I’ve had to wrestle with this question — should I commit or should I quit. In fact, I’m going through this question right now in a very real way, and to be honest, I don’t quite know how it's going to turn out in the long run.  There are some times when you need to let go and try something else. But what I can tell you is that there are definitely times I wanted to give up but kept on going, and I am VERY glad I stuck with it. So in this episode, I want to give you some ways to consider both sides of the question. How can we be more clear about whether we should quit or commit, and how am I using this very same process to think through my current dilemma? All I ask is that you stick around, you know, maybe COMMIT to listening to this episode the whole way through — I know that if you’re facing this question in your life, you’ll get something out of it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend. </strong><br />This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at http://</strong><a href="https://thoughts-on-illustration.simplecast.com/episodes/patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a><br />This helps me cover some of the costs of running the show.</p><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes! </strong><br />Visit http://<a href="https://thoughts-on-illustration.simplecast.com/tomfroese.com/teaching">tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
