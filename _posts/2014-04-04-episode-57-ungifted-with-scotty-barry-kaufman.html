<p>What does it mean to be &quot;gifted&quot;?<br />Is it talent? Creativity? Intelligence? A mixture of all three?<br />Is giftedness something you're born with or can you nurture it?<br />Is it possible to measure and predict giftedness?<br />Our guest today, Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman,  has tackled all these questions in his most recent book Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined. Scott is a cognitive psychologist who specializes in creativity and intelligence. Besides writing books and scholarly articles on the intersection of creativity and intelligence, Scott is a co-founder of The Creativity Post, a blog dedicated to exploring the science behind creativity and imagination.<br />In today's episode, Scott and I talk about intelligence, talent, and giftedness. I think if you're a dad, this show will have a lot of food for thought for you on how to raise your kids to be their best.</p>
