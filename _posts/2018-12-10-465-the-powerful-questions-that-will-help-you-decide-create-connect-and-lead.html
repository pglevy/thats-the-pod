<p>To move forward in life, we typically focus on finding answers. But my guest today argues we should spend more time asking questions. His name is <a href="http://amorebeautifulquestion.com" target="_blank">Warren Berger</a>, and he’s a self-described “questionologist” and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FQT1BMR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07FQT1BMR&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Book of Beautiful Questions: The Powerful Questions That Will Help You Decide, Create, Connect, and Lead</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing why having an inquisitive mindset is more important than ever in this fast changing, uncertain world of ours, but why people are afraid to ask questions. Warren then argues that questions don’t necessarily need to have answers to be useful and explains what he thinks makes a question a "beautiful question." Warren then talks through the importance of asking questions when you're trying to make decisions, be creative, form relationships, and lead people, while providing concrete examples of questions to ask yourself and others to be more effective in each domain.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/beautifulquestion" target="_blank">aom.is/beautifulquestion</a>.</p>
