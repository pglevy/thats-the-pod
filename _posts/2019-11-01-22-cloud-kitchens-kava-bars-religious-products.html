The Hustle's My First Million presents: Million Dollar Brainstorm is back. Host Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and The Hustle CEO Sam Parr (@theSamParr) sit down and discuss what side hustles, trends and big business ideas that's keeping them up at night. This week they talk about food joints that no one visits and only serves people through delivery, bars that get you semi high, making products from the largest free IP: religion, businesses that eliminate choice, non-alcoholic beverages, profiting off book summaries and fixing dog owner issues.If you enjoy this and would like a weekly briefing on super in-depth research in these trends, Sam has offered a discount on The Hustle's Trends newsletter, go to https://trends.co/million.Â
