<p>What I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/386azej">The Tao of Warren Buffett</a> by David Clark and Mary Buffett. </p><p>----</p><p>Come see a live show with me and Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Invest Like The Best on October 19th in New York City. </p><p><a href="https://www.axs.com/events/498660/founder-mentality-patrick-oyshaughnessy-david-senra-tickets?skin=websterhall">Get your tickets here</a>! </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://foundersdaily.supercast.com/">Subscribe to listen to Founders Premium</a> — Subscribers can listen to Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes and every bonus episode. </p><p><i>---</i></p><p>[0:01]The more I heard Warren speak, the more I learned. Not only about investing, but about business and life. </p><p>[4:02] The great personal fortunes in this country weren’t built on a portfolio of fifty companies. They were built by someone who identified one wonderful business. </p><p>[5:45] It is impossible to unsign a contract, so do all your thinking before you sign. </p><p>[8:35] I don’t try to jump over seven-foot bars; I look around for one-foot bars that I can step over. </p><p>[14:27] The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. </p><p>[19:00] My idea of a group decision is to look in the mirror. </p><p>[22:14] When management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact. </p><p>[23:07] Managing your career is like investing—the degree of difficulty does not count. So you can save yourself money and pain by getting on the right train. </p><p>[24:55] There is a huge difference between the business that grows and requires lots of capital to do so and the business that grows and doesn’t require capital. </p><p>[27:00] I look for businesses in which I think I can predict what they’re going to look like in ten or fifteen year; time. Take Wrigley’s chewing gum. I don’t think the Internet is going to change how people chew gum </p><p>[28:50] You want to learn from experience, but you want to learn from other’s people’s experience when you can. </p><p>[29:20] The really good business manager doesn’t wake up in the morning and say, ‘This is the day that I am going to cut costs,’ any more than he wakes up and decides to practice breathing. </p><p>[30:07] A public-opinion poll is no substitute for thought / A story from a young Steve Jobs </p><p>[31:55] The business schools reward difficult, complex behavior more than simple behavior, but simple behavior is more effective. </p><p>[32:42] If you let yourself be undisciplined on the small things, you will probably be undisciplined on the large things as well. </p><p>[35:15] George Lucas unapologetically invested in what he believed in the most: Himself. </p><p>[41:15] No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant. </p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested so my poor wallet suffers</i>. ” — Gareth</p><p>Be like Gareth.
