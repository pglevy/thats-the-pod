<p>When most of us run into obstacles with how we think and approach the world -- whether in terms of dealing with mental health issues like depression and anxiety or simply making progress with our relationships and work, we typically try to focus in on solving the perceived problem, or we run away from it. In either case, instead of feeling better, we feel more stuck.</p>
<p>My guest today says we need to free ourselves from these instincts and our default mental programming and learn to just sit with our thoughts, and even turn towards those which hurt the most. His name is <a href="https://stevenchayes.com/about/">Steven Hayes</a> and he's a professor of psychology, the founder of ACT -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy -- and the author of over 40 books, including his latest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LDSPRYM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07LDSPRYM&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4"><em>A Liberated Mind: How to Pivot Toward What Matters</em></a>. Steven and I spend the first part of our conversation in a very interesting discussion as to why traditional interventions for depression and anxiety -- drugs and talk therapy -- aren't very effective in helping people get their minds right, and how ACT takes a different approach to achieving mental health. We then discuss the six skills of psychological flexibility that undergird ACT and how these skills can be used not only by those dealing with depression and anxiety but by anyone who wants to get out of their own way and show up and move forward in every area of their lives.  </p>
