<p>The Roman caesars were the rulers of the Roman Empire, beginning in 27 BC with Julius Caesar’s heir Augustus, from whom subsequent caesars took their name, and lasting until around the fall of the Western Empire in 476 AD. The caesars transitioned the Roman Republic to autocratic rule, consolidating vast territories under centralized authority and shaping Western governance, law, and culture. Their reign marked one of history's most influential periods, laying the groundwork for modern empires and enduring legacies in political and architectural innovation.</p><p>They also left behind some instructive leadership lessons, in both what and what not to do.</p><p>Here to unpack some of the Roman Empire's most significant caesars as both histories and leadership case studies is Barry Strauss, who is a classicist, professor, military historian, fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, and the author of numerous books, including <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZhA72i"><i>Ten Caesars</i></a>. Today on the show, Barry shares how Augustus consolidated power by initially cleaning house, a redeeming quality of the otherwise infamous Nero, the strategies Vespasian and Severus used to gain legitimacy as outsiders, why Marcus Aurelius was an insightful philosopher but struggled as an emperor, the emperor under whose rule the empire began its decline, what Constantine understood about the idea that if you want things to stay the same, everything must change, and much more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/leadership/leadership-lessons-alexander-hannibal-caesar/" target="_blank">Barry's previous appearance on the AoM podcast: Episode #487 — Leadership Lessons From the 3 Greatest Ancient Commanders</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZgCrIg" target="_blank">Barry's forthcoming book: <i>Jews vs. Rome — Two Centuries of Rebellion Against the World's Mightiest Empire</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-346-fall-roman-republic/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #346: The Fall of the Roman Republic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-969-the-making-of-a-stoic-emperor/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #969: The Making of a Stoic Emperor</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Barry Strauss</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://barrystrauss.com/" target="_blank">Barry's website</a></li><li><a href="https://history.cornell.edu/barry-stuart-strauss" target="_blank">Barry's faculty page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-strauss-8848702" target="_blank">Barry on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/11/813WGJB3MsL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="The book cover of "Ten Caesars" by Barry Strauss depicts a Roman figure in armor.
