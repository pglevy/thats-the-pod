<p>Ronnen Harary built a 4 billion dollar toy company without relying on market research or focus groups. Instead, he believed wholeheartedly in intuition: the "ah-hah" moment that comes from thinking like a 7-year old. Over a 25-year period, he and his Spin Master partners launched innumerable hit toys and amusements, including Air Hogs, Bakugan, and the smash hit franchise PAW Patrol. Spin Master's journey began in the mid-1990s, when Ronnen and his friend Anton Rabie began selling the Earth Buddy, a chia-pet-like novelty gift made of pantyhose, sawdust, and grass seed. Today, it's a publicly traded company with a portfolio that includes TV shows, video games, and toys ranging from puzzles to plush.</p><p>This episode was produced by Casey Herman, with music by Ramtin Arablouei</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Claire Murashima.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>X</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em></a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>
