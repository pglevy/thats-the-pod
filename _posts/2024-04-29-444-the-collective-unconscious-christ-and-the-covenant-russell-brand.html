<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with actor and podcaster Russell Brand. They discuss the language of symbols, the collective unconscious, the evolution of theology, and why so many public intellectuals are coming back to Christ.</p><p> </p><p>Russell Brand is an English comedian, actor, podcaster, and commentator. He first established himself as a stand up comedian and radio host before becoming a film actor. He presented for MTV UK and made appearances across media and TV throughout the 2000’s. In 2008, he leapt from British to U.S. film acting, appearing in the hit film “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” followed by numerous international successes. In 2013, Brand guest-edited an edition of the weekly publication the New Statesman, launching his interest and later career as a political activist and commentator. His current podcast, Stay Free, sees Brand calling out major news, governments, and corporations for affronts to free speech, expression, spirituality, and thought.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>2024 tour details can be found here https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  </p><p> </p><p>Peterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Russell Brand:</p><p> </p><p>Stay Free on Rumble https://rumble.com/c/russellbrand</p><p> </p><p>Stay Free on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/@RussellBrand</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/rustyrockets </p>
