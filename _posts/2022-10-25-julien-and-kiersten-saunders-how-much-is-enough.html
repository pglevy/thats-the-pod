<p>Our guests on the podcast today are Kiersten and Julien Saunders. Together they blog about finance and life at the website <a href="http://richandregular.com/" target="_blank">richandregular.com</a>. And they’re also the authors of a new book called <i>Cashing Out: Win the Wealth Game by Walking Away</i>. In addition, they co-host the <i>rich & REGULAR</i> podcast. After discovering the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement in 2012, they proceeded to pay off $200,000 in debt and walked away from their corporate jobs before turning 40.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://richandregular.com/our-story/">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://richandregular.com/listen/"><i>rich & REGULAR</i></a> podcast</p><p><a
