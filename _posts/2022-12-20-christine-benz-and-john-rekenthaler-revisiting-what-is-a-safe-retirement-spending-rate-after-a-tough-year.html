<p>On this week’s episode, we’ll be chatting about “The State of Retirement Income” study that Christine and I recently co-authored with our colleague John Rekenthaler, who joins us for this conversation. This is the second year we’ve conducted this study, which examines how much retirees can safely withdraw in retirement. Much has changed since last year as the stock and bond markets have sold off and inflation has risen sharply. This can create uncertainty about whether retirement assets will sustain spending over a multidecade horizon, an issue we explore in this study. In this episode, I’ll be asking Christine and John about “The State of Retirement Income” study and key takeaways. For reference, you can find a link to the study in the show notes to this episode.</p><p>Safe Withdrawal Rates</p><p>“<a href="https://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf" target="_blank">Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data</a>,” by William Bengen,<i> Journal of Financial Planning, </i>October 1994.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/lp/the-state-of-retirement-income">The State of Retirement Income</a>,” by Christine Benz, Jeff Ptak, and John Rekenthaler, <a href="http://morningstar.com/" target="_blank">Morningstar.com</a>, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1128840/whats-a-safe-withdrawal-rate-today">What’s a Safe Withdrawal Rate Today?</a>” by Christine Benz and John Rekenthaler, <a href="http://morningstar.com/" target="_blank">Morningstar.com</a>, Dec. 13, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2017/How-Much-do-you-Know-When-it-Comes-to-Preparing-For-Retirement-Fidelitys-Retirement-IQ-Survey-Uncovers-Significant-Knowledge-Gaps/default.aspx">How Much Do You Know When It Comes to Preparing for Retirement?
