<p>In today's hyper-competitive market in which technology is eating jobs, what sets the successful companies and workers apart from the ones that flounder? My guest today argues it could be something as little as saying hello and helping an old lady with her wheelchair. </p><p>His name is Tom Peters, and he's a business expert and the author of several books on professional success. His latest is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DHM8LH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B074DHM8LH&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Excellence Dividend: Meeting the Tech Tide With Work That Wows and Jobs That Last</em></a>. </p><p>Today on the show, Tom and I discuss why the human touch and striving for excellence is what will give companies and workers an advantage in today's market. Tom shares why execution beats strategy in business and in life, how companies can develop a culture of excellence, and why the businesses that put customers first win in the long run. Tom then makes the impassioned case that business managers should see themselves as “coaches of excellence” and that they have more of an impact on the lives of people than we give them credit for. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/excellencedividend" target="_blank">aom.is/excellencedividend</a>.</p>
