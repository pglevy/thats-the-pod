Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) dive deep into 75 Hard: what it is, who's behind it, and why it's so successful. From there they talk about a similar business: Beachbody. Beachbody does over $1B in sales, but the way they generate their profits will surprise you. The guys also brainstorm on "HackerNews for X" ideas and how to pull them off. Towards the end, Sam challenges Shaan on why he's running so many businesses and not focusing on just one.
