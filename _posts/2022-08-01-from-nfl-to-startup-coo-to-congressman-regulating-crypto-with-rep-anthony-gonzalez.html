<p>This episode is a first for Acquired: we’re joined by a sitting US Congressman (from Ben’s home state of Ohio!), Republican House Representative Anthony Gonzalez. Anthony serves on the House Financial Services Committee and is <em>deeply</em> involved in crypto and Web3 regulation, as well as on the Climate and Science, Space &amp; Technology Committee where he oversees NASA among many other agencies. His also has an absolutely incredible story — his family immigrated from Cuba to Ohio, he played in the NFL, he was COO of an Investment Group of Santa Barbara backed startup, and he was one of a small number of Republican congresspeople who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the events January 6th. </p><p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!). </p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgVKvqTItto">Schoolhouse Rock “I’m Just a Bill”</a></li><li><a href="https://www.50xpodcast.com/episodes/transdigm-foundations-with-nick-howley/"> Nick Howley and TransDigm</a> on Will Thorndike's new podcast <a href="https://www.50xpodcast.com/">50x</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p><em>‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
