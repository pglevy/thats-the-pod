<p>Jordan Peterson sits down with clinical psychologist, author, and media mogul Dr. Phil McGraw. They discuss his new book, “We’ve Got Issues,” and from this delve into the three pillars of western society that are now under assault, as well as the 10 working principles he prescribes to defend them. They also discuss how to live with intention, the importance of personal identity removed from outward labels, the difference between questioning and deconstructing, how the establishment failed our children during the pandemic, and the obvious outbreak of social contagions plaguing the world today.</p><p> </p><p>Phillip McGraw, PH.D. is the author of 10 New York Times bestsellers. For 21 seasons he hosted the award-winning talk show “Dr. Phil,” one of the most successful daytime programs in television history. His new book, “We’ve Got Issues – How You Can Stand Strong For America’s Soul and Sanity,” is available now. This April, he hosts “Dr. Phil Primetime,” on his own cable network, Merit Street Media, providing essential news and entertainment. McGraw resides in Dallas, Texas with his wife, Robin. They have two adult sons and four grandchildren.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>2024 tour details can be found here https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  </p><p> </p><p>Peterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Dr. Phil:</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve Got Issues” (Book)</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/Weve-Got-Issues-Strong-Americas/dp/1668061708</p><p> </p><p>On X https://twitter.com/DrPhil?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</p><p> </p><p>Dr. Phil Primetime (website) https://www.drphil.com/ </p>
