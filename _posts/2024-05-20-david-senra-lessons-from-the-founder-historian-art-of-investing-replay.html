Today, we are revisiting our class with David Senra in honor of our upcoming event together. David is an absolute force of nature who is taking the world by storm with his podcast "Founders." In this class, we enjoy access to the full spectrum of learnings from his decade-long study of history's greatest entrepreneurs, artists, athletes, and leaders.
The library David's built reflects a range of study that is completely boundless. From Alexander the Great, to Catherine Graham, to Alexander Graham Bell, from Warren to Jimmy Buffet, and from J. Gold all the way to Jay Z. He helps us gain an understanding of why virtually all of the greats in history devote themselves to the study of those that came before them. Please enjoy today's class with David Senra.
