Dan then gives us his recommendations on sauce, cheese, and toppings in order to create the perfect pizza pie, including his take on that most burning of questions: does pineapple belong on a pizza?</p><h2>Connect With Dan Richer</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.thejoyofpizzabook.com/"><i>Joy of Pizza</i> Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/danricher/?hl=en">Dan on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://razzanj.com/">Website for Dan's Razza restaurant</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/03/91nY5490oL.jpeg" alt="" /><h2>Â </h2>
