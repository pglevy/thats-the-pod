<p>Listeners may remember that last year Wailin watched ALL of the holiday rom-coms and decided to share them with me on our ill-advised holiday bonus episode. Well, we&apos;re bringing it back! This year Wailin made Shaun watch The Knight Before Christmas. It&apos;s got magic, chivalry, time travel, wide-legged pants, and an inexplicable post-credit scene. Is the holiday bonus episode still ill-advised? Yes. But, is it fun? Also, yes! Happy Holidays to all of our listeners and we&apos;ll be back in 2020 with more stories.</p>
