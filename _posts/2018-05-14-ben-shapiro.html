<p>See www.jordanbpeterson.com/events Shapiro discussion starts at about 4:20 if you want to skip the tour information. This is an alternate posting of Ben Shapiro's May 6 premiere Sunday Special discussion with me (https://bit.ly/2I4czoU). Ben and I had a very intense discussion about the nesting of human perception and cognition in the mythic world - a better discussion, I think, than I've had with anyone. </p><p> </p>
