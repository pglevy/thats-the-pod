<p>World record setting powerlifter Chris Duffin embodies what Teddy Roosevelt called the &quot;strenuous life.&quot; Not only has he trained hard to lift superhuman amounts of weight, but  he's strived to be the best man he can be in his family and professional life. His story of grit and drive to overcome obstacles and become a success is truly an inspiration. Chris and I discuss strength training and why men should be physically strong, but we also discuss how he has managed his time to balance family, work, and competitive powerlifting.</p>
