<p><a href='https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/about-us/our-team/eduardo-repetto.html'>Eduardo Repetto, Ph.D.</a>, is the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Avantis Investors, where he is responsible for directing the research, design, and implementation of investment strategies for over $10 billion in factor-based ETFs and mutual funds. Prior to Avantis Investors' establishment in 2019, Eduardo was Co-Chief Executive Officer, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Director at Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA funds).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this podcast, we discuss Eduardo’s career, his successes at DFA and now at Avantis. The conversation centers on factor investing, and primarily small-cap value investing. What does the past data say, what's new in factor investing today, and does it make sense to consider this niche part of the equity market for a slice of your equity portfolio? </p>
