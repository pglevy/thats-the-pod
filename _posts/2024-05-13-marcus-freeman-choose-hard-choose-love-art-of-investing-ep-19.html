Today’s teacher is Marcus Freeman, Head Football Coach at the University of Notre Dame. We discuss the power of relationships and how he talks with his players about the concepts of hard work and love, and we delve into what it takes to focus on inputs rather than outputs, especially as the college sports world is changing in unprecedented ways. 
For you football fans out there, we even get into a little bit of what's ahead for Notre Dame’s program in Marcus’s third year as head coach. As alums and lifelong fans of the Irish, it was a real treat to host Coach Freeman at our studios. Please enjoy this class with Coach Marcus Freeman.

Join us for the Art of Investing x Founders Conference!
