<p>Henry David Thoreau is one of America’s most influential thinkers and writers. 164 years after it was published, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B08IAAC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01B08IAAC&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Walden</em></a><em> </em>continues to inspire readers to get out into nature and march to the beat of their own drummer. </p><p>But what was the worldview of the man who wrote those immortal words? </p><p>Well, for one thing, Thoreau believed in the existence of fairies. </p><p>That’s one of the insights my guest mined as he explored the intellectual and spiritual life of Henry David Thoreau. His name is Kevin Dann and in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E4WAGLW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01E4WAGLW&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Expect Great Things: The Life and Search of Henry David Thoreau</em></a><em>, </em>he takes readers on a tour of the inner life of a uniquely American philosopher. </p><p>Today on the show I talk to Kevin about the mystical life of Henry David Thoreau, and why Kevin would actually say that mystical isn't quite the right word to describe Thoreau. And yes, we dig into Thoreau’s belief in fairies and how, despite his magical outlook on life, he was also a keen scientific observer. </p><p>You’re never going to read Walden the same way after listening to this episode.</p>
