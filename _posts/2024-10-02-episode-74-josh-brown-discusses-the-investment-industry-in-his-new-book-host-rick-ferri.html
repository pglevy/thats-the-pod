<p>Josh Brown is a well-known author, columnist, creator of the widely read blog The Reformed Broker, a commentator on CNBC, and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, an independent investment advisory firm he founded with Barry Ritholtz. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Josh worked for 10 years as a broker at various investment firms, where he learned the hard truths about how clients are routinely treated—and how their money is sent on a one-way trip to Wall Street’s coffers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A prolific writer, Josh co-authored two books, How I Invest Money and The Clash of the Financial Pundits, and authored two books, Backstage Wall Street, and just released You Weren’t Supposed to See That, which we discuss in this podcast. Josh stopped blogging as The Reformed Broker in 2023 and now publishes the DowntownJoshBrown.com blog.</p>
