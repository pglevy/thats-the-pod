<p>In this episode I chat with James Hughes about his new book, The Illustrator's Guide, a comprehensive, motivational handbook for artists trying to break into the freelance illustration market. James is an agent at Folio Illustration and Animation Agency, representing some 60 illustrators around the world. Taking advice from James means learning from someone who sits at the front lines of both illustrators and the clients who hire them every day.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p><ul><li>How to Balance Personal Taste with Market-Readiness in your Art</li><li>Tips for Building Your Portfolio</li><li>What to Work On While You're Waiting for Real Client Work</li><li>How to Submit Work to an Agent</li><li>What Not to Do When Reaching Out to an Agent</li><li>And much more!</li></ul><p><strong>Show Links</strong></p><p>Please use my Affiliate Links to support the podcast!</p><ul><li>Buy the Illustrator's Guide in Canada: https://amzn.to/4dV7a1q</li><li>Buy the Illustrator's Guide in the US: https://amzn.to/4fdl6oq</li><li>The Illustrator's Guide Website - http://theillustratorsguide.com</li><li>The Illustrator's Guide YouTube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/@TheIllustratorsGuide</li></ul><p><strong>How to Support This Podcast</strong></p><p>If you love Thoughts on Illustration, help us to keep going in one of these easy ways:</p><ol><li>Tell your friends by sharing this episode or a link to the podcast on social media</li><li>Like, Subscribe, and Leave a Comment (YouTube and on the Spotify App)</li><li>Become an $8 Drawing Buddy on Patreon!
