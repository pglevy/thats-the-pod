Today we celebrate the extraordinary life of John Glynn, Founder of Glynn Capital, who passed away earlier this year with a more than 50 year career as a technology investor. As an early investor in a who's who of technology companies, from Intel to Facebook, John developed a reputation as both an astute arbiter of mega-trends, as well as a capital partner of choice to talented founders.
In addition to investing, John was revered as a gifted teacher. For over 30 years, he taught courses on venture capital and entrepreneurship at his alma mater's Virginia and Stanford GSB.
Even more than his investing success and teaching accolades, John will be remembered as a devoted family man. To properly honor John, we enlisted the help of our friend Patrick O'Shaughnessy to join us in interviewing John's son, David, who is Managing Partner of Glynn Capital. I hope you enjoy our class with Patrick and David as we honor the late, great John Glynn.
