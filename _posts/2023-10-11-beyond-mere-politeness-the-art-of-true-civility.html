<p>It often seems like we live in a very inconsiderate, indifferent, and ill-mannered time and that the cure for what ails our abrasive and disjointed relations is a lot more politeness. But my guest would say that what we really need is a revival of civility.</p><p>Today on the show, Alexandra Hudson — author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3rKHSB5"><i>The Soul of Civility: Timeless Principles to Heal Society and Ourselves</i></a> — explains the difference between politeness and civility, and how being civil can actually require being impolite. We discuss how civility ensures the health of democracy, and good government relies on citizens' ability to govern themselves and check each other, which may require acting a little like . . . Larry David. We talk about what Homer's Odyssey can teach us about the art of hospitality, the relationship between civility and integrity, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/etiquette/how-manners-made-the-world/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How Manners Made the World</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/400Mv73" target="_blank"><i>Class: A Guide Through the American Status System</i> by Paul Fussell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/podcast-746-the-confucian-gentleman/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #746: The Confucian Gentleman</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/the-manly-art-of-hospitality/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Manly Art of Hospitality</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uooY1nkwgQI" target="_blank">"Chat and cut" scene on <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm </i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3F8gH6A" target="_blank"><i>The Odyssey</i> translated by Emily Wilson</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Alexandra Hudson</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://alexandraohudson.com/" target="_blank">Alexandra's website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.civic-renaissance.com/" target="_blank">Alexandra's Substack: Civic Renaissance </a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/10/81P2rUrUQFL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
