<p>Jim VandeHei didn’t have an auspicious start in life. His high school guidance counselor told him he wasn’t cut out for college, and he went on to confirm her assessment, getting a 1.4 GPA at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and spending more time drinking beer than planning his career.</p><p>Eventually, though, Jim turned things around for himself, going on to co-found two of the biggest modern media outlets, Politico and Axios.</p><p>Jim shares how he started moving up the rungs of success and building a better life for himself in his new book <a href="https://amzn.to/3UeI2e8"><i>Just the Good Stuff: No-BS Secrets to Success (No Matter What Life Throws at You)</i></a>. Today on the show, Jim shares the real-world lessons he’s learned in his career. We discuss the importance of matching passion to opportunity, making your own luck, surrounding yourself with the right people, keeping the buckets of your happiness matrix filled, understanding the difference between wartime and peacetime leadership, harnessing the energy of healthy revenge, and more.</p><h2><strong>Connect With Jim VandeHei</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.axios.com/authors/jim" target="_blank">Jim at Axios</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/04/71cDtpaGetL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Book cover for "Just the Good Stuff" featuring a simplified graphic of a stick figure walking on an arrow, written by Jim VandeHei, with subtitles about No-BS Secrets of Success." width="325" /><h2><br /> </h2>
