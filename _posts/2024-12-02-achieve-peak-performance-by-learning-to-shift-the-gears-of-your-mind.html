<p>The Industrial Revolution changed the nature of work, so that many people labored in factories, continuously performing the same task, at the same pace, for the duration of their shift.</p><p>Two centuries on, even though most folks have moved from working with their hands to working with their heads and from manufacturing set outputs to solving complex problems, generating creative ideas, and processing information, we still tend to work as if we're manning an assembly line.</p><p>My guest says that being stuck in this factory framework is to our detriment, and that there's a much better way to do knowledge work, one that's less like manning an assembly line and more like driving a car.</p><p>Mithu Storoni is a Cambridge-trained physician, a neuroscience researcher, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3OwEBwX"><i>Hyperefficient: Optimize Your Brain to Transform the Way You Work</i></a>. Today on the show, Mithu offers a modern approach to achieving peak performance and explains why it's better to impose the natural rhythms of our brains on our work than to impose the rhythms of our work on our brains. She shares why you should treat your brain like an engine with three different gears, how people have different "gear personalities," and how to use environmental cues, specially structured 90-minutes cycles of work, and even caffeine to shift your brain into the optimal gear for different mental challenges.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-525-how-to-stress-proof-your-body-and-brain/" target="_blank">Mithu's previous appearance on the AoM podcast: Podcast #525: How to Stress Proof Your Body and Brain</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-743-how-to-get-time-priorities-and-energy-working-in-your-favor/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #743: How to Get Time, Priorities, and Energy Working in Your Favor</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Mithu Storoni</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.mithustoroni.com/" target="_blank">Mithu's website</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/MithuStoroni?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Mithu on X</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mithustoroni/?hl=en" target="_blank">Mithu on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mithu-storoni-0488872a/" target="_blank">Mithu on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/11/71csGUMhwL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Book cover: "Hyper Efficient" by Mithu Storoni.
