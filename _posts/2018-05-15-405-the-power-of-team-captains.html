<p>What makes a great sports dynasty a great sports dynasty? We typically think it’s the result of amazing talent or coaching.<br />But my guest today argues that it all comes down to the often quiet, understated leadership of a team captain. His name is Sam Walker and he’s the author of the book &quot;The Captain Class: The Hidden Force That Creates the World’s Greatest Teams.&quot;<br />Today on the show, Sam and I discuss his quest to uncover what makes great teams great and the unlikely answer he came up with. We then discuss the traits Sam found in the great team captains of sports history. Some of them you’d expect to see on a list about great leadership, including doggedness and humility, but a few of them, like the willingness to push the limits of the rules and engage in conflict with the players and the coach, might surprise you. Throughout the conversation, Sam shares insights on how leaders from all fields can apply these lessons in the teams they play on and work with. <br />Get the full show notes at aom.is/captainclass.</p>
