<p>In this week's episode, we talk to Mark Sisson, author of The Primal Blueprint. Mark argues that what we know about health and fitness is wrong and that we should actually be taking our cues from cavemen. We discuss how men can start living the primal lifestyle today and begin the path towards better health.</p>
