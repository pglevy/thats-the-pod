<p>In the finale of the Adventures of Pinocchio and Free Speech series, we visit many different episodes of this podcast. From the UK to the US and from Cambridge to Canada; we are fighting against the (not so) slow erosion of one of the most powerful forces that many would consider inalienable. The power with which God created the world. The power that can combine a family through marriage or tear it apart through war. The spoken and written word. The pen is mightier than the sword.</p><p><br /></p><p>—Links—</p><p>Understand Myself Personality Test:</p><p>https://understandmyself.com</p><p><br /></p><p>—Chapters—</p><p>[03:14:44] Ideologies of good & evil </p><p>[03:20:50] Student organizations vs. Dr. Rima Azar </p><p>[03:26:11] Cancel Culture with Dr. Julie Ponesse </p><p>[03:28:52] A relationship with the Great Father</p><p>[03:30:12] Dr. Azar speaks up </p><p>[03:38:40] Defining hate speech with Andrew Doyle </p><p>[03:49:01] Tyranny & free speech with James Orr & Arif Ahmed </p><p>[03:51:36] Corruption of critics in film distribution with Prager & Carolla</p><p>[03:56:58] Truckers & Joe Rogan with Dr. Julie Ponesse </p><p>[04:03:04] The master of fire and Pinnochio turning a whale into a dragon </p><p>[04:05:30] UK legislation post-Cambridge with James Orr & Arif Ahmed </p><p>[04:11:48] Pinnochio’s choice </p><p>[04:12:13] Would I do it again? with Bret Weinstein</p><p>[04:15:22] Pinnochio’s finale</p><p> </p>
