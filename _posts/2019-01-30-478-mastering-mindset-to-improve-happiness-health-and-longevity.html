<p>Having a positive mindset comes with an unbelievable number of benefits, from better physical and mental health, to improved relationships and performance at work. If you've got a more negative bent, you're really missing out on a lot.  </p><p>Fortunately, my guest says it's possible to shift into a more positive gear. Her name is Dr. Catherine Sanderson and sheâ€™s a professor of psychology at Amherst College. In her latest book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1946885444/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1946885444&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Positive Shift</em></a>, she highlights scores of studies that show how a positive mindset can make us healthier and happier, and how that mindset can be achieved. Today she shares those insights with us, beginning with debunking the idea that a positive outlook means being naively Pollyanna-ish in disposition. Catherine then walks us through what the research says about the surprisingly robust benefits of having a positive perspective which affect every area of your life. We then discuss specific tactics you can use to develop a more positive outlook, even if you have an inborn inclination towards being negative. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/positiveshift" target="_blank">aom.is/positiveshift</a>.</p>
