<p>Please take the 2019 Acquired Survey. It takes 5-10 minutes, helps us immensely, and you may win a pair of new AirPods or a free 1-year subscription to the LP show! <a href="http://acquired.fm/survey">http://acquired.fm/survey</a></p><p>We wrap up Season 4 with a very special (and accidental!) episode, a conversation with the CEO of Superhuman, the red hot email productivity app which just announced their $33m Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz. While originally intended as an LP episode, we felt Superhuman would provide the perfect bookend to our “modern enterprise productivity trilogy” following our Zoom and Slack episodes. We hope you enjoy the conversation with Rahul as much as we did, and we’ll see you later this summer for Season 5!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Links</p><ul><li>New York Times article announcing the fundraise: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/superhuman-email.html"> https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/superhuman-email.html</a> </li><li>Rahul’s Medium post on acquisitions: <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/rip-mailbox-or-founders-how-to-stop-worrying-and-love-being-acquired-261da4f6d566"> https://medium.com/swlh/rip-mailbox-or-founders-how-to-stop-worrying-and-love-being-acquired-261da4f6d566</a></li><li>Rahul on finding product-market fit on First Round Review: <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/"> https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/</a></li></ul>
