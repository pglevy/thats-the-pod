<p>This week I talk to strength training expert and author Mark Rippetoe about barbell training. We discuss why a man should be strong, the benefits of barbell training over machines, old-time strongmen, the importance of form in barbell training, the main lifts every man should be doing and much, much more. In next week's episode I field questions to Mark that AoM readers had for him.</p>
