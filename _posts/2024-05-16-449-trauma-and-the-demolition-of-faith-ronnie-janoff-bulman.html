<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with social psychologist and author, Ronnie Janoff-Bulman. They discuss how most implicit beliefs are consciously unknown to those who hold them; the human reactions to fear, disgust, pain, and the destruction of hope; why people blame themselves for truly random events; what the experts get wrong about motivation; and the difference between proscriptive and prescriptive morality.</p><p> </p><p>Ronnie Janoff-Bulman is Professor Emerita of Psychology and Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. She is a social psychologist and the author of two books and over 90 published papers. Her first book, “Shattered Assumptions: Towards a New Psychology of Trauma,” has been cited over 9,500 times. She was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for her research on morality, which serves as the backbone of her recent book, “The Two Moralities: Conservatives, Liberals, and the Roots of Our Political Divide.” She is the recipient of teaching and mentoring awards and is the former editor of Psychological Inquiry, an international journal devoted to advancing theory in psychology.  A mother and grandmother, Dr. Janoff-Bulman lives in Amherst, Massachusetts with her husband of over 50 years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>2024 tour details can be found here https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  </p><p> </p><p>Peterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Ronnie Janoff-Bulman:</p><p> </p><p>Shattered Assumptions (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Assumptions-Towards-Psychology-Trauma/dp/0743236254</p><p> </p><p>The Two Moralities (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Two-Moralities-Conservatives-Liberals-Political-ebook/dp/B0BX1JDL8C/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=qQoj5&content-id=amzn1.sym.cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&pf_rd_p=cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&pf_rd_r=138-3764402-1287437&pd_rd_wg=H5RDI&pd_rd_r=fccdebc5-a090-4e01-b536-33c552e5005f&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk </p>
