<p>Even though the legendary poet Homer wrote the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> thousands of years ago, my guest would say that these epic poems are just as relevant and significant today, and even represent a kind of scripture.</p><p>His name is Adam Nicolson, and he’s the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3PszYE7"><i>Why Homer Matters</i></a>. Today on the show, Adam makes the case that the <i>Iliad</i> is really the story of a collision between a more rooted, civilized way of life, represented by the character of Hector, and a nomadic, honor-bound gang ethos, represented by Achilles. We talk about how this collision birthed the character of Odysseus — who was both great warrior and subtle diplomat — and the whole Greek consciousness. And we discuss how that consciousness is also our consciousness, as we’re still wrestling with the warring impulses, dramas and dilemmas, and big questions of human experience Homer gave life.</p><h2><strong>Resources Related to the Episode</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3VNUy3Q" target="_blank">Robert Fagles’ translation of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/hector-achilles-two-paths-manliness/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Hector and Achilles: Two Paths to Manliness</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/podcast-337-life-lessons-odyssey/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #337: What Homer’s Odyssey Can Teach Us Today</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/3-lessons-from-homers-odyssey/" target="_blank">AoM Article: 3 Lessons From Homer’s Odyssey</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/manly-honor-part-i-what-is-honor/" target="_blank">AoM Article: What Is Honor?</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/12/9781250074942.jpg" alt="" width="325" />
