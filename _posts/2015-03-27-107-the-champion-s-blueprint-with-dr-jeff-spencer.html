<p>Is success a skill that can be learned? Why are some people afraid of success? And what blind spots cause the successful to crash and burn? Well, my guest today has some ideas about these questions. His name is Dr. Jeff Spencer and he's spent his career helping top-performers-- athletes, CEOs, government leaders-- perform at their very best. We discuss his &quot;Champion's Blueprint&quot; and how the average Joe can apply it in his own life. Lots of great actionable steps in this podcast. Take notes!</p>
