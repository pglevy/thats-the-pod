<p>Today on the podcast, we welcome back Mark Berg. Mark is the founder of and lead advisor at Timothy Financial Counsel, which is an hourly financial planning firm that he started in 2000. Prior to launching Timothy Financial, Mark served as a client manager at a fee-only financial planning firm, and he has provided fee-only financial guidance since 1995. He holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Wheaton College and is a certified financial planner practitioner and NAPFA-registered financial advisor. He served on the national board of directors for the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors from 2008 through 2011. In the spirit of full disclosure, Timothy Financial is the firm that my husband and I use for financial planning. I have no financial relationship with the firm other than that we pay them for their services.</p><p>Background</p><p><a href="https://timothyfinancial.com/team/#mark-berg">Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://timothyfinancial.com/about/">Timothy Financial Counsel</a></p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/mark-berg-hourly-financial-planning-is-vast-blue-ocean">Mark Berg: Hourly Financial Planning Is ‘A Vast Blue Ocean</a>,’” <i>The Long View</i> podcast, Morningstar.com, March 28, 2023.</p><p>Funding for College</p><p>“<a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/tips-for-grandparents-using-a-529-plan-to-save-for-college">529 Plan Tips for Grandparents to Save for College</a>,” by Emma Kerr, usnews.com, Sept. 7, 2021.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/how-allocate-assets-college-savings">How to Allocate Assets for College Savings</a>,” by Christine Benz, Morningstar.com, Jan. 19, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/morningstar-529-ratings-best-plans">Morningstar 529 Ratings: The Best Plans of 2024</a>,” by Hyunmin Kim, Morningstar.com, Oct. 29, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/what-do-with-extra-money-your-529-plan">What to Do With Extra Money in Your 529 Plan</a>,” by Amy Arnott, Morningstar.com, June 30, 2022.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/best-way-save-college">The Best Way to Save for College</a>,” by Christine Benz and Susan Dziubinski, Morningstar.com, Oct. 11, 2022.</p>
