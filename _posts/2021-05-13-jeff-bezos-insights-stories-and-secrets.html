<p>What I learned from <a href="https://amzn.to/3uJlch2">Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon</a> by  Colin Bryar and Bill Carr.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>[3:58] <strong>What is best for the customer? Do that</strong>: "Amazon believes that long-term growth is best produced by putting the customer first. If you held this conviction, what kind of company would you build?"</p><p>[7:05] <strong>Jeff skips the conferences and dinners:</strong> "95 percent of the time I spent with Jeff was focused on internal work issues rather than external events like conferences, public speeches, and sports matches."</p><p>[25:08] <strong>Don't encourage communication—eliminate it:</strong> "Jeff said many times that if we wanted Amazon to be a place where builders can build, we needed to eliminate communication, not encourage it. When you view effective communication across groups as a "defect," the solutions to your problems start to look quite different from traditional ones." (There is nothing conventional about Jeff) </p><p>[27:29] <strong>Why companies must run experiments:</strong> "Time and time again, we learned that  consumers would behave in ways we hadn't imagined especially for brand-new features or products."</p><p>[30:16] <strong>Jeff on the importance of making decisions quickly:</strong> "Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure."</p><p>[30:48] <strong>Great anything is rare:</strong> "Great Two-Pizza team leaders proved to be rarities. Although we did identify a few such brilliant managers, they turned out to be notoriously difficult to find in sufficient numbers, even at Amazon." </p><p>[34:30] <strong>A simple tip from Jeff on how to produce unique insights:</strong> "Jeff has an uncanny ability to read a narrative and consistently arrive at insights that no one else did, even though we were all reading the same narrative. After one meeting, I asked him how he was able to do that. He responded with a simple and useful tip that I have not forgotten: he assumes each sentence he reads is wrong until he can prove otherwise. He's challenging the content of the sentence, not the motive of the writer.”</p><p>[35:12] <strong>Why Amazon works backwards:</strong> "Working Backwards is a systematic way to vet ideas and create new products. Its key tenet is to start by defining the customer experience, then iteratively work backwards from that point until the team achieves clarity of thought around what to build."</p><p>[40:00] <strong>Working backwards on Kindle:</strong> "We were working forward, trying to invent a product that would be good for Amazon, the company, not the customer. When we wrote a Kindle press release and started working backwards, everything changed. We focused instead on what would be great for customers. An excellent screen for a great reading experience. An ordering process that would make buying and downloading books easy. A huge selection of titles. Low prices. We would never have had the breakthroughs necessary to achieve that customer experience were it not for the press release process, which forced the team to invent multiple solutions to customer problems."</p><p>[43:58] <strong>Patience. Then bet big:</strong> Our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution. Once we had a clear vision for how these products could become businesses that would delight customers, we invested big. Patience and carefully managed investment over many years can pay off greatly. </p><p>[46:03] <strong>Have Steve Jobs level of belief in your products:</strong> "Jobs calmly and confidently told us that even though it was Apple's first attempt to build for Windows, he thought it was the best Windows application anyone had ever built."</p><p>[54:48] <strong>Amazon's Kindle strategy was influenced by Apple:</strong> "In digital, that meant focusing on applications and devices consumers used to read, watch, or listen to content, as Apple had already done with iTunes and the iPod. We all took note of what Apple had achieved in digital music in a short period of time and sought to apply those learnings to our long-term product vision."</p><p>[56:48] <strong>Good ideas are rare. When you find one bet heavily:</strong> "At some point in the debate, someone asked Jeff point blank: "How much more money are you willing to invest in Kindle?" Jeff calmly turned to our CFO, Tom Szkutak, smiled, shrugged his shoulders, and asked the rhetorical question, "How much money do we have?"</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders by investing in a subscription to Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
