Way bigger.</p><p>(21:10) Over 20 years into his career and dude ain’t changed. He’s got his own vibe. You gotta love him for that. (Rick Rubin)</p><p>(21:41) <a href="https://amzn.to/3Do5Pz9">Against The Odds: An Autobiography</a> by James Dyson (Founders #200)</p><p>(25:27) I believe you can speak things into existence.</p><p>(27:20) Picking the right market is essential.</p><p>(29:29) All companies that go out of business do so for the same reason – they run out of money. —Don Valentine </p><p>(29:42) There are two things in business that matter, and you can learn this in two minutes- you don’t have to go to business school for two years: high gross margins and cash flow. The other financial metrics you can forget. —Don Valentine </p><p>(31:54) I went on the road with Big Daddy Kane for a while. I got an invaluable education watching him perform.</p><p>(33:12) Everything I do I learned from the guys who came before me. —Kobe</p><p>(34:15) I truly hate having discussions about who would win one on one or fans saying you’d beat Michael. I feel like Yo (puts his hands up like stop. Chill.) What you get from me is from him. I don’t get 5 championships without him because he guided me so much and gave me so much great advice.</p><p>(34:50) <a href="https://amzn.to/3mHZRmB">Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography</a> (Founders #214)</p><p>(37:20) This is a classic piece of OG advice.

Jordan said the same thing about Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.</p><p>[46:43] If you got the heart and the brains you can move up quickly. There's no way to quantify all of this on a spreadsheet, but it's the dream of being the exception.</p><p>(52:26) He (Russell Simmons) changed the business style of a whole generation. The whole vibe of startup companies in Silicon Valley with 25 year old CEOs wearing shell toes is Russell's Def Jam style filtered through different industries.</p><p>(54:17) Jay Z’s approach is I'm going to find the smartest people that that know more than I do, and I'm gonna learn everything I can from them.</p><p>(54:49) He (Russell Simmons) knew that the key to success was believing in the quality of your own product enough to make people do business with you on your terms. He knew that great product was the ultimate advantage in competition.</p><p>(55:08) In the end it came down to having a great product and the hustle to move it.</p><p>(56:37) Learn how to build and sell and you will be unstoppable. <a href="https://amzn.to/3wFpJkC">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness</a> (Founders #191)</p><p>(58:30) We gave those brands a narrative which is one of the reasons anyone buys anything.

Munger</strong></a>.

That is the kind of consistency that you can get only by adding dead serious discipline of whatever talent you have.</p><p>(1:21:37) when you step outside of school and you have to teach yourself about life, you develop a different relationship to information. I've never been a purely linear thinker. You can see it to my rhymes. My mind is always jumping around restless, making connections, mixing, and matching ideas rather than marching in a straight line,</p><p>(1:27:41) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/founderspodcast">Samuel Bronfman: The Life and Times of Seagram’s Mr. Sam</a> (Founders #116)</p><p>(1:34:15) The real bullshit is when you act like you don't have contradictions inside you. That you're so dull and unimaginative that your mind never changes or wanders into strange, unexpected places.</p><p>(1:36:25) <strong>There are extreme levels of drive and pain tolerance in the history of entrepreneurship</strong>.</p><p>(1:38:45) <a href="https://amzn.to/3iAdjFW">Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business</a></p><p>(1:42:24)  I love sharp people.

You can't sleep— one eye open for real and forever.</p><p>(1:51:49) The thought that this cannot be life is one that all of us have felt at some point or another. When a bad decision and bad luck and bad situations feel like too much to bear those times. When we think this, this cannot be my story, but facing up to that kind of feeling can be a powerful motivation to change.</p><p>(1:54:18) Technology is making it easier to connect to other people, but maybe harder to keep connected to yourself.</p><p>----</p><p>Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders at <a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Founders Notes</a></p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
