<p>I talk with fitness expert, bodybuilder, and business consultant John Romaniello about his book Man 2.0: Engineering the Alpha. John and I discuss what it means to be &quot;alpha&quot;; how Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey can make you a better man; how to increase your testosterone; intermittent fasting; how pounding down 14,000 calories of ice cream in one setting may help you lose fat; dogmatism in the fitness industry; and how journaling can calm your frantic mind. Note: There's some adult language in this episode so if you usually listen with your 10 year old son, you may want to have him skip this one and give him the Cliff's Note Version.</p>
