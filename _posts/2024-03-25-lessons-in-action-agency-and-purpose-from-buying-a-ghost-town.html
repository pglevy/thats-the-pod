<p>In the 19th century, Cerro Gordo, which sits above Death Valley, was the largest silver mine in America, a place where dreamers came to strike it rich. In the 21st century, Brent Underwood used his life savings to buy what had become an abandoned ghost town, and ended up finding a very different kind of wealth there.</p><p>Brent has spent four years living in Cerro Gordo and has documented the details of the mines he’s explored, the artifacts he’s found, and how he’s restoring the town on his popular YouTube channel, Ghost Town Living. Now, in a book by the same name, he takes a wider-view lens on his adventures there and shares the big lessons he’s learned from his experiences and from the original residents of Cerro Gordo. We get into some of those lessons on today’s show. We first talk about how and why Brent bought a ghost town as a way of escaping a typical 9-5 life and finding a deeper longer-term purpose. We then discuss what restoring Cerro Gordo has taught him about the necessity of getting started and taking real action, how learning the context of what you do can add greater meaning to it, the importance of understanding the long-term consequences of short-term thinking, the satisfactions that come with being a high-agency person, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burro_Schmidt_Tunnel" target="_blank">Burrow Schmidt Tunnel</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owens_Lake" target="_blank">Owens Lake</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/become-a-self-starter-autonomy-as-the-key-to-personal-motivation/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Become a Self-Starter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/meditations-wisdom-action/" target="_blank">AoM Article:Meditations on the Wisdom of Action</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Brent Underwood</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GhostTownLiving" target="_blank">GhostTown Living on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/?hl=en" target="_blank">Brent on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/underwoodbrent" target="_blank">Brent on X</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/03/A1xtOCrDg5L._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" width="325" />
