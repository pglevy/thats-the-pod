Rockefeller, Sr</a> by Ron Chernow (Founders #16)</p><p>[2:35] <a href="https://amzn.to/3lnAB3B">Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Changed America</a> by Les Standiford.

(Founders #115) <i>“This industry visible to our neighbors began to give us character and credit," Franklin noted. One of the town's prominent merchants told members of his club, "The industry of that Franklin is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed." Franklin became an apostle of being-and, just as important, of appearing to be-industrious. Even after he became successful, he made a show of personally carting the rolls of paper he bought in a, wheelbarrow down the street to his shop, rather than having a hired hand do it</i>.</p><p>[8:54] <a href="https://amzn.to/3G0Bpoo">Ogilvy on Advertising</a> (Founders #82) <i>Set yourself to becoming the best-informed person in the agency on the account to which you are assigned.

Spend Saturday mornings in service stations, talking to motorists. Visit your client’s refineries and research laboratories. At the end of your first year, you will know more about the oil business than your boss, and be ready to succeed him</i>.</p><p>[10:50] <a href="https://amzn.to/3FKJRqb">The Essays of Warren Buffett</a> by Warren Buffett and Lawrence Cunningham.

That it is an immense task building a successful company. It's silly to go out and diversify into other lines or to make other investments.

Rockefeller. (Founders #148)</p><p>[19:44] Warren Buffett on MOATs: <i>On a daily basis, the effects of our actions are imperceptible; cumulatively, though, their consequences are enormous. When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable actions, we describe the phenomenon as "widening the moat." When short-term and long-term conflict, widening the moat must take precedence</i>.</p><p>[20:06] The way I define moat: Why are you difficult to compete with?</p><p>[26:54] For the last 14 or 15 years I have devoted myself exclusively to my business.</p><p>[28:00] He had become a creator instead of an accumulator and he had found much more satisfaction in such an accomplishment.</p><p>[30:40] <a href="https://amzn.to/3iRFVKO">Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy: Ernest Hemingway's Secret Adventures, 1935-1961</a> by Nicholas Reynolds. (Founders #194)</p><p>[35:54] You have to admire Julia Tuttle.
