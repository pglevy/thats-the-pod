<p>First responders and members of the military have physically and mentally demanding jobs. To tackle those jobs effectively, they need to be in shape physically and mentally. But most first responders have erratic schedules that make working out difficult, so that many don’t, and consequently suffer from injuries and poor health. My guest today is a former Navy SEAL on a mission to solve that problem. His name is Adam La Reau, and he's the founder of <a href="http://o2x.com" target="_blank">O2X</a>, an organization dedicated to training tactical athletes.</p><p>Adam walks us through the unique challenges soldiers and first responders have when it comes to physical fitness and explains his philosophy on training “tactical athletes.” We then discuss insights civilians can take away from how first responders train, including making time for working out on an erratic schedule, managing stress, and making recovery a priority.</p><p>We end our conversation discussing the other organization Adam founded called <a href="http://onesummit.org" target="_blank">One Summit</a>, which pairs children who have cancer with a Navy SEAL mentor who helps the kids gain greater resilience through rock climbing.</p><p>Get the show notes and resources at <a href="http://aom.is/O2X" target="_blank">aom.is/O2X</a>.</p>
