Our teacher today is Harvard Business School legend, Andre Perold. Born and raised in South Africa, Andre taught at HBS for over 30 years, earning numerous awards for both his research and teaching excellence. If you were an aspiring investor attending HBS, Andre's class felt like the only class that mattered.
He co-founded HighVista Strategies, a now leading investment firm that has $10 billion of AUM and focuses on investing in structurally inefficient opportunities across both public and private markets.
In this session, Andre deconstructs the concept of compounding with an appreciation for both the academic and practical components. It was such a privilege to have Andre joined us in class as he represents the pinnacle of investor-teachers. I hope you enjoy our class with Professor Andre Perold.
