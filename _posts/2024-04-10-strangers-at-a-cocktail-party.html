<p>Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founders of 37signals, dive into their book REWORK and discuss the essay “Strangers at a Cocktail Party” with Rework host, Kimberly Rhodes. From their experience, hiring too many people at once can throw off the balance and continuity of a company&apos;s culture. They talk about the importance of gradual assimilation and how culture is implicit, not always written down. They share insights on the value of fresh perspectives and the excitement of facing challenges head-on.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p><p>00:30 - Gradually integrating new hires is important for upholding an organization&apos;s established norms and values.<br/><br/>02:30 - Company culture is nurtured through the daily interactions and collective experiences shared within an organization.<br/><br/>05:34 - New hires inject new perspectives and innovative ideas into the mix.<br/><br/>07:14 - Embracing crises and novel challenges is part of the excitement of running a business.<br/><br/>12:19 - Reflecting on the hiring patterns at 37signals.<br/><br/>14:23 - While change is essential for adjusting the company&apos;s culture and strategy, it&apos;s vital to implement it carefully and minimize disruptions.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Links and Resources:</b></p><p><a href='https://amzn.to/43ZWj36'>The Half-Life of Facts</a> by Samuel Arbesman</p><p><a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlL_rsmcRMZcvyx1DeQbk3vUoa8LleoqA&amp;si=P0VPykg_YQS_mHVP'>All About Atlas - Boston Dynamics Robot</a></p><p><a href='https://37signals.com/books'>Books by 37signals</a></p><p><a href='https://basecamp.com/pricing'>Sign up for a 30-day free trial at Basecamp.com</a></p><p><a href='https://www.hey.com/world/'>HEY World | HEY</a></p><p><a href='https://www.rework.fm/'>The REWORK podcast</a></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@37signals/podcasts'>The Rework Podcast on YouTube</a></p><p><a href='https://dev.37signals.com/'>The 37signals Dev Blog</a></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/basecamp/featured'>37signals on YouTube</a></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/37signals'>@37signals on X</a></p>
