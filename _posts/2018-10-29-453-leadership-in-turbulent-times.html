<p>Are great leaders born or made? Do circumstances make great leaders or do great leaders change the times? These are a few of the big picture questions my guest explores in her latest book. Her name is Doris Kearns Goodwin, sheâ€™s a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and in her latest book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476795924/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1476795924&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Leadership: In Turbulent Times</em></a><em>,</em> she explores the makings of great leaders by looking at the biographies of four US presidents who led the country through periods of crisis: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson.</p><p>We begin our conversation discussing the ambition all four of these leaders had as young men to do something great and how they connected their personal ambition to the greater good. We then discuss the personal setbacks all of them experienced early in life and how these challenges influenced them as leaders. Doris then shares the leadership traits and skills all of them implemented during their presidencies as well as how they did things differently. We end our conversation discussing whether any other leader could have managed the crisis each of these presidents confronted or if these men were singularly suited to the circumstances.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/turbulent" target="_blank">aom.is/turbulent</a>.</p>
