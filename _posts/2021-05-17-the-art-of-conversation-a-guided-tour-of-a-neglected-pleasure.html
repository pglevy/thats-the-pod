<p>How do you form a meaningful connection with another person? Well, it starts with simply opening your mouth. From there, my guest says, you want to progress through a conversation, or perhaps a series of conversations, in a particular sequence of stages that will form an effective on-ramp towards a stronger relationship.</p>
<p>Her name is <a href="http://www.judyapps.co.uk/">Judy Apps</a>, she's a speaking and voice coach and the author of several books on communication, including<em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592404979/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1592404979&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4">The Art of Conversation</a></em>. Today Judy and I discuss that art, beginning with why it's so important to learn. We then get into the different levels a conversation should progress through in order to build intimacy and smoothly segue into discussing the things that matter most. Judy explains how to bring the kind of energy to a conversation that creates connection, and two exercises you can use to overcome the self-consciousness that can thwart that energy. Along the way, we discuss how conversation is both a game that you can have fun practicing, and a dance that can flow into some of life's most magical moments.</p>
