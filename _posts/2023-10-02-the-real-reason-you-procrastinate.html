<p>If you or someone you know has a problem with procrastination, you've probably chalked it up to a deficiency in time management skills or self-control. But my guest says there are deeper reasons underlying procrastination, and he'll unpack what they are today on the show.</p><p>Joseph Ferrari is a Catholic deacon, a professor of psychology, and a foremost researcher and expert on procrastination who has authored or co-authored 400 professional articles and 35 books and textbooks. Today on the show, Dr. Ferrari explains the psychological dynamics behind procrastination and what you can do to counter them. He also shares the difference between regular and chronic procrastination, which of your parents you probably got your propensity to procrastinate from, and how procrastination can manifest in indecision.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Select books/textbooks Joseph has authored/co-authored on procrastination:<ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PuVEQd" target="_blank"><i>Still Procrastinating: The No Regrets Guide to Getting It Done</i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3t9xMdC" target="_blank"><i>Procrastination and Task Avoidance: Theory, Research, and Treatment</i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PuVTuB" target="_blank"><i>Counseling the Procrastinator in Academic Settings</i></a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/stop-procrastinating-today-with-behavioral-science/" target="_blank">AoM Article:Stop Procrastinating Today With Behavioral Science</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/how-to/podcast-444-how-to-use-the-procrastination-equation-to-start-getting-things-done/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #444: How to Use the Procrastination Equation to Start Getting Things Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/get-better-without-torturing-yourself-the-power-of-temptation-bundling/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Get Better Without Torturing Yourself — The Power of Temptation Bundling</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Dr. Joseph Ferrari</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://csh.depaul.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/psychology/joseph-ferrari.aspx" target="_blank">Joseph's faculty page</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/10/test.jpg" alt="" />
