<p>Â AI is all the rage right now. There are billions of dollars now flowing into the space, with large and small companies all competing to create the next big thing. But in addition to lots of money, building new AI models requires top-tier researchers. So, who's attracting the best? And what does it take to be considered top talent in AI anyway? On this episode we speak with Damien Ma, managing director at MacroPolo, the in-house think tank of the Paulson Institute. Damien helps put together MacroPolo's <a href="https://macropolo.org/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/" data-stringify-link="https://macropolo.org/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-destination="https://macropolo.org/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/">Global AI Talent Tracker</a>, which monitors the flow of top-tier AI researchers around the world. We discuss who's winning the AI talent war so far, the purported talent drain in China, competition from India, and much more.</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>
