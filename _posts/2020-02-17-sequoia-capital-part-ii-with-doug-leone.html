<p>The wait is over. Acquired returns with a very special Part II of the Sequoia Capital story, joined by the very best person in the world to help us tell it - Doug Leone. Since 1996, Doug has served as Sequoia’s Global Managing Partner, in charge of overseeing the firm’s incredible expansion from a single, $150m early-stage fund focused on Northern California to the multi-billion dollar global powerhouse it is today. Doug is incredibly candid and insightful about all that has gone into building the modern Sequoia: from winning Google and missing Facebook, to the enormous (and enormously successful) bet on decentralized expansion in China and India, to the firm’s “proudest moment” at the depth of the dot com bust. This episode is an absolute must-listen for anyone in the tech, startup and venture ecosystems today. Thank you to Doug and all of the Sequoia team for joining us to make it happen!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Note:</p><ul><li>You can listen to Part I of our Sequoia story, which dives deep into the history and background of the firm, here: <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/sequoia-capital-part-1">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/sequoia-capital-part-1</a></li></ul><p>Sources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.brunswickgroup.com/sequoia-capital-doug-leone-silicon-valley-i11786/"> https://www.brunswickgroup.com/sequoia-capital-doug-leone-silicon-valley-i11786/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/newsletter/2018-06-20-doug-leone"> https://www.sequoiacap.com/newsletter/2018-06-20-doug-leone</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Er4QcNdjVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Er4QcNdjVU</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-leone-a2714/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-leone-a2714/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cl8X02Xd1I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cl8X02Xd1I</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJgwKiEpaI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJgwKiEpaI</a></li></ul>
