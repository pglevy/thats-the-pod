<p>Five years before he became a massively successful content creator, Dhar Mann was nearly broke and living in a studio apartment. Itâ€™s the kind of story he might tell in one of his videos: bite-sized, live-action morality tales that have earned 60 billion views across YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms. Raised in an Indian Sikh family, Dhar had a strong entrepreneurial drive, which led to early business success, but also a spectacular downfall when he got pulled into a Ponzi scheme. A few years after losing nearly everything, he began making short, dramatic videos that conveyed life lessons. Nobody watched at first and critics called them cheesy, but today, Dhar has a huge production studio in Burbank, where dozens of&nbsp; employees make content for tens of millions of subscribers.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Alex Cheng and Casey Herman, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research help from Katherine Sypher.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>X</em></a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a>, and email us at&nbsp;<em>hibt@id.wondery.com</em>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>
