<p>Do you feel overwhelmed? Do you feel like you're always busy but not productive? Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas? <br />If you can answer yes to any of those questions, today's episode is for you. I talk to business consultant Greg McKeown about his book &quot;Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less.&quot; In it, Greg argues that by doing less we can actually not only be more productive, but, more importantly, get more of the right things done in life.<br />We begin our conversation talking about the differences between an essentialist and a non-essentialist, and why essentialists look at every decision with a 100-year view. Greg then shares how you can apply essentialist principles to your work so that you can convince your boss that maybe some of the stuff you’re working on isn’t that important. We then discuss why taking time for play, sleeping, or doing absolutely nothing can sometimes be the most productive thing you can do. Greg then shares tips on how to say no to people without feeling like a jerk and why adding buffer to your life is an important part of being an essentialist. <br />This podcast is filled with both brass tacks advice and deep insights about living a flourishing life. You’re going to want to take notes.</p>
