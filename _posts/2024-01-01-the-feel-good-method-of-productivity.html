<p>When we think about getting more done, we tend to think about working harder, exerting more willpower, and buckling down; we tend to think of doing things that are unpleasant, but that we deem worth it, for the productivity boost they offer.</p><p>But what if the key to greater productivity ran the other way round, and the easier and more enjoyable you made your work, the more of it you’d get done?</p><p>That’s the premise of Ali Abdaal’s new book <a href="https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=podtour&utm_source=artofmanliness"><i>Feel-Good Productivity</i></a>. In addition to being a new author, Ali is a doctor, a YouTuber, and the world’s most followed productivity expert. Today on the show, Ali unpacks the three prongs of his feel-good approach to productivity: energerize, unblock, and sustain. We talk about how to inject your work with more play, flip the confidence switch, find joy in increasing your power, harness relational energy, and use the 10-10-10 rule for overcoming hesitation in taking action. We also discuss why smart goals aren’t always effective and what’s a better alternative, why you might want to put a five-minute hourglass on your desk, the three types of burnout and how to overcome each, and much more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/motivation-over-discipline/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Motivation Over Discipline</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/7-habits-proactive-not-reactive/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The 7 Habits — Be Proactive, Not Reactive</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/the-7-habits-begin-with-the-end-in-mind/" target="_blank">The 7 Habits: Begin With the End in Mind</a></li><li><a href="https://londonwriterssalon.com/" target="_blank">London Writer’s Salon</a></li><li><a href="https://strenuouslife.co/" target="_blank">The Strenuous Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/make-exercise-a-sustainable-habit/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #575: Counterintuitive Advice on Making Exercise a Sustainable Habit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-292-road-character/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #292: The Road to Character</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/podcast-716-how-to-make-your-life-more-effortless/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #716: How to Make Your Life More Effortless</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Ali Abdaal</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=podtour&utm_source=artofmanliness" target="_blank">Feel Good Productivity website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal" target="_blank">Ali‘s YouTube channel</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal" target="_blank">Ali on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aliabdaal/?hl=en" target="_blank">Ali on IG</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/12/71OaqBjwOyL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" width="325" />
