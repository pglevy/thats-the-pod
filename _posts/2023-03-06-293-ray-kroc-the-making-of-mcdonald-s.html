<p>What I learned from rereading <a href="https://amzn.to/3IRSnqV">Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's</a> by Ray Kroc.</p><p>----</p><p>This episode is brought to you by: <a href="https://www.tiny.com/">Tiny</a>: Tiny is the easiest way to sell your business.

I was a battle-scarred veteran of the business wars, but I was still eager to go into action. I was 52 years old. I had diabetes and incipient arthritis. I had lost my gall bladder and most of my thyroid gland in earlier campaigns. But I was convinced that the best was ahead of me.</p><p>[6:00] It’s not what you do it’s how you do it:</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3YefiTv">Ralph Lauren: The Man Behind the Mystique</a> by Jeffrey Trachtenberg.

They were invariably linked to some form of action.</p><p>[10:00] For me, work was play.</p><p>[13:00] I vowed that this was going to be my only job. I was going to make my living at it and to hell with moonlighting of any kind. I intended to devote every ounce of my energy to selling, and that's exactly what I did.</p><p>[14:00] <a href="https://amzn.to/3rI5bbz">Francis Ford Coppola: A Filmmaker's Life</a> by Michael Schumacher. (Founders #242)</p><p>[20:00] This was the first phase of grinding it out—building my personal monument to capitalism. I paid tribute, in the feudal sense, for many years before I was able to rise with McDonald's on the foundation I had laid.</p><p>[21:00] Make every detail perfect and limit the number of details to perfect.</p><p>[26:00] I was putting every cent I had and all I could borrow into this project.</p><p>[28:00] Perfection is very difficult to achieve and perfection was what I wanted in McDonald's. Everything else was secondary.</p><p>[29:00] If my competitor was drowning, I'd put a hose in his mouth.</p><p>[44:00] <a href="https://amzn.to/3t1WYQl">Titan: The Life of John D.
