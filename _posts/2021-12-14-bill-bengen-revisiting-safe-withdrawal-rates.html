<p>Our guest on the podcast today is William Bengen. Bill has been a prolific researcher of retirement planning matters over his career, and he pioneered the exploration of safe withdrawal rates with his groundbreaking 1994 research that gave birth to what's now called the 4% rule. Bill is the former owner of Bengen Financial Services, an independent Registered Investment Advisor that he launched in 1989, after his family sold the soda-bottling business that he had helped manage. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT. Bill retired from his financial planning practice in 2013 but continues to conduct research on retirement planning and withdrawal rates. We're excited to have him here today.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-bengen-21b159196/" target="_blank">Bio</a></p><p><strong>In-Retirement Withdrawal Rates and Asset Allocation</strong></p><p>“<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-originator-of-the-4-retirement-rule-thinks-its-off-the-mark-he-says-it-now-could-be-up-to-4-5-51611410402" target="_blank">The Originator of ‘the 4% Rule’ Thinks It’s Off the Mark.
