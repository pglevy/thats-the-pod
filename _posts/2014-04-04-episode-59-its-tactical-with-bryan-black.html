<p>Today I talk to Bryan Black, founder and owner of ITS Tactical. ITS Tactical is dedicated to providing &quot;knowledge that empowers individuals with indispensable skill-sets to explore their world and prevail against all threats.&quot; You'll find content on emergency prep, wilderness survival, and self-defense on ITS Tactical. It's sort of like Boy Scouts, but manlier.<br />Bryan and I talk about why he started ITS Tactical, the tactical skills every man should know, and the gear every man should have to be prepared for any situation.</p>
