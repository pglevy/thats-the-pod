<p>Season 5, Episode 10: The Lean Startup and the Long-Term Stock Exchange (with Eric Ries) </p><p>Acquired closes out Season 5 and 2019 with a radical look into both the past and future decades of startup company building, investing and - yes, exiting - in conversation with legendary Lean Startup author Eric Ries.
