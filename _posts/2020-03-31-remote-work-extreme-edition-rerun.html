<p>We place a long-distance phone call to Antarctica to chat with Kathrin Mallot, an astrophysicist who works at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in the South Pole. In this episode, Kathrin talks about preparing for a work assignment in a super remote part of the world; practicing self-care during the punishing Antarctic winter; getting along with coworkers that you also live with in close quarters; frozen nose hairs, snacks, Internet access, and more! This episode was originally run in February 2019.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p>The IceCube <a href='https://icecube.wisc.edu/'>website</a> - 00:46</p><p><a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-a-neutrino/'>What is a neutrino?</a> (Scientific American) - 1:13</p><p><a href='https://www.snolab.ca/'>SNOLAB</a> in Canada is an example of a neutrino observatory located in an old mine - 1:58</p><p><a href='https://www.emsisoft.com/en/'>Emsisoft</a> - 2:48</p><p><a href='https://www.usap.gov/technology/contentHandler.cfm?id=4297'>Skynet satellite</a> (and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)'>the other Skynet</a>) - 4:38</p><p><a href='https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mt-erebus'>Mt.
