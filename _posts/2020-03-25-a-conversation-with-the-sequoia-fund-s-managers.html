<p>(A note to listeners: We recorded this interview before the recent sell-off took began, explaining why it’s not discussed. We’ll address the recent downturn in future installments of The Long View. Please enjoy this episode and thanks again for listening.)</p><p>Our guests this week are Arman Kline and Trevor Magyar of investment management boutique, Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, or RCG for short. Arman and Trevor sit on the five-person investment committee at RCG that oversees management of all client assets, including those held in the Sequoia Fund.
