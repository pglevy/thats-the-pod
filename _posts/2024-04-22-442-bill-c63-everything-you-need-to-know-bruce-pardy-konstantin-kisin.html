<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with Canadian lawyer Bruce Pardy and podcaster Konstantin Kisin. They discuss Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Bill C63 (aka The Online Harms Act), what powers it gives to the government, what rights it strips from citizens, and why even Americans should be concerned.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Professor Pardy is a classically liberal legal academic for whom equal application of the law, negative rights, private property, limited government, and separation of powers are foundational to the Canadian and Western legal tradition. A critic of legal progressivism, social justice, and the discretionary administrative state, he has written on a range of pressing legal subjects at the front lines of the culture war inside the law, including environmental governance, climate change, energy policy, human rights and freedoms, professional and university governance, property and tort theory, free markets, and the rule of law. He has taught at law schools in Canada, the United States, and New Zealand; practiced civil litigation at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP in Toronto; served as adjudicator and mediator on the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal; and has published and commented widely in traditional and online media.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Konstantin Kisin is a Russian-British satirist, social commentator, and co-host of the TRIGGERnometry Youtube show. He is also the author of “An Immigrant's Love Letter to the West,” a Sunday Times bestseller. He has written for several publications, including Quillette, The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph, and Standpoint, on issues relating to tech censorship, woke culture, comedy, and other topics, but he currently publishes articles on his popular Substack. Kisin made headlines in 2018 when he refused to sign a "safe space contract" to perform comedy at a British college and again in 2023 when he participated in an Oxford Union debate on the motion of "This House Believes Woke Culture Has Gone Too Far." His speech at the debate received viral attention and has been seen by over 100 million people around the world.</p><p> </p><p><br /> </p><p>- Links -</p><p><br /> </p><p>2024 tour details can be found here https://jordanbpeterson.com/events   </p><p><br /> </p><p>Peterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/  </p><p><br /> </p><p><br /> </p><p>For Bruce Pardy:</p><p><br /> </p><p>On X <a href="https://twitter.com/pardybruce?lang=en">https://twitter.com/pardybruce?lang=en</a></p><p><br /> </p><p><br /> </p><p>For Konstantin Kisin:</p><p><br /> </p><p>TRIGGERnometry Podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7oPkqeHTwuOZ5CZ-R9f-6w">   / @triggerpod  </a></p><p><br /> </p><p>Substack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqblFwTXI1Z1pVQUVHdVpMSWpFQng2cF9ETHRfQXxBQ3Jtc0trOS15Z2lBaFRYeXBTSThTVjc4NmpGcGZxUUlFeTlBWmJ6QXc5LTdBUVdITHhYcEhXRHU0SzVSeHZ4OEY4cjkyNWU3VVFrUWhralQzTnMyR19VQ0hfTnhOaWpIdXpmNVlQazdXTjVPZWJTT25DYmNOVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fkonstantinkisin.substack.com%2F&v=xnpUFLD_xlw">https://konstantinkisin.substack.com/</a></p><p><br /> </p><p>Twitter<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazVmS2JCVUE4TzdyN0VGVXE1SnQxYThFdVRnd3xBQ3Jtc0ttZ2dyVGxaU3hLTEl2N24yNndSbWJldmdPYTFET3lDNGpzNnRNRWxDZlhsMTNBdXdxQnRRR1lKbmhzanEyS2o0MWNNRU00QTY2SFVWQ1Exa05rN29QRmt0R3BFc3M5QTQ3X09GLWVfWG5wSEh2c29DOA&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FKonstantinKisin%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor&v=xnpUFLD_xlw"> https://twitter.com/KonstantinKisin?r...</a></p>
