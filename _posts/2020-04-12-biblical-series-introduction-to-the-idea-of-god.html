<p>On this Easter Sunday, we bring you our first lecture from Jordan Peterson's Biblical Series. These lectures (previously only available on You Tube) will be released in full, and along with selections from his Q&A. We hope you enjoy this series at a time in our history when so many are turning to the Bible for faith, hope, and understanding. </p><p> </p>
