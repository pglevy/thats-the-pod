<p>On this episode of the Jordan Peterson Podcast, Jordan was joined by Yeonmi Park. Yeonmi Park is a North Korean defector and human rights activist trying to shine a light on the atrocities still being committed in North Korea by the current Kim regime. She wrote her experiences into a bestseller, ‘In Order to Survive.’ She tells stories of her childhood and escaping to remind the world of how terrible things are for North Koreans.</p><p> </p>
