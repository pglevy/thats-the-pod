<p>It's a tough job to manage a household. Things need to be regularly fixed, maintained, and cleaned. How do you stay on top of these tasks in order to keep your home in tip-top shape?</p><p>My guest knows his way all around this issue and has some field-tested, insider advice to offer. Charles MacPherson spent two decades as the major-domo or chief butler of a grand household. He's also the founder of North America's only registered school for butlers and household managers and the author of several books drawn from his butlering experience, including <a href="https://amzn.to/4c6KlIt"><i>The Butler Speaks: A Return to Proper Etiquette, Stylish Entertaining, and the Art of Good Housekeeping</i></a>.</p><p>In the first part of our conversation, Charles charts the history of domestic service and describes why the practice of having servants like a butler and maid ebbed in the mid-20th century but has made a comeback today. We then turn to what average folks who don't have a household staff can do to better manage their homes. Charles recommends keeping something called a "butler's book" to stay on top of household schedules and maintenance checklists. We then discuss how to clean your home more logically and efficiently. Charles shares his golden rules of house cleaning, the cleaning task you've probably neglected (hint: go take a look at the side of the door on your dishwasher), his surprising choice for the best product to use to clean your shower, how often you should change your bedsheets, and much more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/heading-out-on-your-own-day-14-establish-a-simple-cleaning-routine-and-stick-to-it/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Establish a Simple Cleaning Routine and Stick to It</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/how-to-clean-house-in-30-minutes/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Clean Your Entire House in 30 Minutes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/how-to-clean-like-a-man/" target="_blank">AoM Article: How to Clean Like a Man</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/keep-your-house-in-tip-top-shape-an-incredibly-handy-home-maintenance-checklist/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Keep Your House in Tip-Top Shape — An Incredibly Handy Home Maintenance Checklist</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ItKpo6" target="_blank"><i>The Book of Household Management</i> by Isabella Beeton</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Charles MacPherson</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.charlesmacpherson.com/" target="_blank">Charles' website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/03/5122Nbe5eHL._SL1200_.jpg" alt="Cover of the book "The Butler's Guide" by Charles Macpherson, featuring a butler illustration and information about etiquette, entertaining, and managing household." />
