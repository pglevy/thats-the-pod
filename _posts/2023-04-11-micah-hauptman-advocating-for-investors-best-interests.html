<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Micah Hauptman. Micah is the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit association of nearly 300 national, state, and local pro-consumer organizations. He leads CFA’s investor protection work through conducting research and engaging in advocacy on investor protection issues, focusing primarily on the regulation of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker/dealers, particularly as they relate to the provision of retail investment products and services. Prior to rejoining CFA in early 2022 Micah served as counsel to Securities and Exchange Commission commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, and before that he served as CFA’s financial services counsel for nearly seven years. He also worked at Public Citizen on a broad range of banking and tax issues and started his career as a prosecutor for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office.
