<p>Walking. It can seem, well, rather pedestrian. </p><p>But my guest today makes the case that walking can act as a gateway to explore memory, meaning, and what it means to be human. His name is Erling Kagge, he’s an adventurer and philosopher, and we had him on the show last year to discuss his book <a href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qkn-wNgCNfWXMdSUTeKlhZYAAAFuZWjE7wEAAAFKAWmdQqs/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XK5812S/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=.CY.clF97rpwHe8.dQ0Nfw&slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B06XK5812S&linkCode=w61&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Silence</em></a> (<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/erling-kagge-interview-silence/" target="_blank">that's episode 433</a>). Erling’s latest book is called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/152474784X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=152474784X&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>Walking</em></a>, and we begin our conversation discussing the connection between bipedal locomotion and silence and how walking instead of driving can help slow down time and deepen our memories. Erling makes the case that embracing voluntary hardship can enrich your life and how walking can be a step towards that. He then shares why going for a walk can help you solve problems, why most great philosophers were also committed walkers, what the Adam and Eve story can teach us about the need for exploration, and how walking can be one of the most radical things you can do in the modern age.</p><p>You'll want to take a walk after listening to this show, or maybe you'll walk while you're listening.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/walking" target="_blank">aom.is/walking</a>.</p>
