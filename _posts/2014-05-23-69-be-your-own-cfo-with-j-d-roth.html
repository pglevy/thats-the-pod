<p>I talk to J.D. Roth, founder of the personal finance blog Get Rich Slowly, on why we all need to become the Chief Financial Officers of our lives. J.D. and I discuss taking financial practices from the business world and applying to our personal finances. If you've been wanting to get a better hold on your finances, you'll get a lot of this podcast.</p>
