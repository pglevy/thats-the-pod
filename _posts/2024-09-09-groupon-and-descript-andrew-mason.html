<p>Andrew Mason was a 27-year-old with a degree in music when he co-founded one of the fastest growing companies of all time: Groupon. Its deep discounts on everything from sushi rolls to plastic surgery soon became a ubiquitous part of life in cities across the world. In 2011, just three years after launching, Groupon had the largest internet IPO since Google, with a valuation of $12.7 billion.</p><p><br></p><p>But people began to complain that Andrew was not up to the role of CEO: he was quirky and unpredictable, and unable to navigate the company’s rocket-ship growth and the surge of copycats that threatened it. Soon, Groupon’s revenue slumped, and Andrew was fired from the company he’d started. But like many of the best entrepreneurs, he learned from his failure. Today, Andrew runs a new startup, an audio and video editing platform called Descript. In fact, we use Descript to make this show!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei.</p><p><br></p><p>Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Kathrine Sypher. Our audio engineers were Maggie Luthar and Robert Rodriguez.</p><p><br></p><p>You can follow HIBT on <a href="https://twitter.com/HowIBuiltThis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/howibuiltthis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and email us at <a href="mailto:hibt@id.wondery.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hibt@id.wondery.com</a>.
