<p>And we are thrilled to have with us today two fabulous investors in global equities. David Herro is here from Harris Associates. He is a longtime portfolio manager at Oakmark International and Oakmark International Small Cap. Rajiv Jain, to David’s left, is here from GQG Partners, which he founded in 2016. Both of these gentlemen have strategies that are rated Gold by Morningstar’s Manager Research team. So, we’re really excited to have them here and to dig into international investing and the case for international investing.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://harrisassoc.com/who-we-are/our-team/david-herro/">David Herro Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/oakix/quote">Oakmark International Investor</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/oakex/quote">Oakmark International Small Cap Investor</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajiv-jain-9bb97784/">Rajiv Jain Bio</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/gqrpx/quote">GQG Partners Global Quality Equity</a></p><p><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/gqgpx/quote">GQG Partners Emerging Markets Equity</a></p><p><strong>International Funds, Interest Rates, and More</strong></p><p>“<a href="https://oakmark.com/news-insights/going-where-the-value-is-greater-international-equities/">Going Where the Value Is Greater: International Equities</a>,” by David Herro, <a href="http://oakmark.com/" target="_blank">oakmark.com</a>, Jan. 4, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://gqg.com/insights/bloomberg-interview-rajiv-jain-spotlights-nvidia-discusses-elections-indias-potential-and-china/">Bloomberg Interview: Rajiv Jain Spotlights Nvidia, Discusses Elections, India’s Potential, and China</a>,” <a href="http://gqg.com/" target="_blank">GQG.com</a>, June 11, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f0c9d6e-23a2-42f3-9ec4-aa414d30ea40">Fund Manager Rajiv Jain Takes $2.8bn Bet on Middle Eastern Stocks</a>,” by Jennifer Hughs and Brooke Masters, <a href="http://ft.com/" target="_blank">ft.com</a>, Jan. 14, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/harrowing-story-top-managers-biggest-mistake">The Harrowing Story of a Top Manager’s Biggest Investing Mistake</a>,” by Gregg Wolper, <a href="http://morningstar.com/" target="_blank">Morningstar.com</a>, Aug. 30, 2023.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2407006/david-herros-1stquarter-international-equity-market-commentary-granolas-japan-and-crypto-why-we-dont-chase-momentum">David Herro’s 1st-Quarter International Equity Market Commentary: Granolas, Japan, and Crypto—Why We Don’t Chase Momentum</a>,” by Sydnee Gatewood, <a href="http://gurufocus.com/" target="_blank">gurufocus.com</a>, April 9, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/griffin-fed-rate-cuts-2024">Billionaire Fund Manager Griffin Predicts Fed Rate Cuts in 2024</a>,” by Dan Weil, <a href="http://thestreet.com/" target="_blank">thestreet.com</a>, May 7, 2024.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/04/08/jamie-dimon-head-of-us-largest-bank-warns-of-8-interest-rates-along-with-recession/">Jamie Dimon—Head of US’ Largest Bank—Warns of 8% Interest Rates Along With Recession</a>,” by Derek Saul, <a href="http://forbes.com/" target="_blank">forbes.com</a>, April 8, 2024.</p>
