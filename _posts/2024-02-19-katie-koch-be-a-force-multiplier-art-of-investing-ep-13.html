Our teacher today is Katie Koch. Katie is the President and CEO of the TCW Group, a storied firm with over $200 billion in assets under management and a fascinating 50-year legacy as a pioneer in the investment industry. Katie just took the TCW reins in 2023 after more than 20 years at Goldman Sachs. She joined Goldman right after college as the self-proclaimed least capable person in the firm and rose to become chief investment officer of their 300-billion-dollar public equity business. 
Katie has been a champion for expanding opportunities for students, and one initiative in particular is the Women's Investing Summit, which has become the preeminent all-female-led investing conference in higher education. With the sixth annual Women's Investing Summit on February 29th, we thought it would be fun to have Katie join us in the classroom to unpack her remarkable career. Please enjoy our class with the wonderful force multiplier, Katie Koch.
