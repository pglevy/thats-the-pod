<p>There are conversations between friends. Conversations between family. And conversations in the media. But did you know there's also been a conversation going on between writers, thinkers, and philosophers for a couple thousand years? What's been called "the Great Conversation" refers to the way the authors of the so-called "Great Books" have for millennia been referencing and riffing on the work of their predecessors, and this dialogue is one you can not only eavesdrop on yourself, but join in.</p><p>My guest today founded an online community that helps people take part in the Great Conversation. His name is Scott Hambrick, and he's both a Starting Strength barbell lifting coach, and the creator of <a href="http://onlinegreatbooks.com" target="_blank">Online Great Books</a>, a program which helps people read and discuss the classic texts of Western literature. Today on the show Scott and I discuss where the idea of the Great Books came from, why they're worth reading, and how to read them. Along the way, we offer sample questions to think about when you're reading these texts, as well as mini models of exchanges you can have with others about them. </p><p>This show will likely inspire you to pick up a copy of <em>The</em> <em>Iliad</em> or something by Plato.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/onlinegreatbooks" target="_blank">aom.is/onlinegreatbooks</a>.</p>
