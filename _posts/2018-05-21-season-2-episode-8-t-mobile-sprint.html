<p>If you thought the telecom business was boring, think again! Acquired brings you an episode packed with more drama than an entire season of Game of Thrones. Starting with a death in the family, we follow a tale of fortunes lost and rebuilt, bitter battles between rivals who once worked for each other, and at the center of it all, a lesson in the power of stable cashflow businesses. This is one call you don’t want to drop!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/t-mobile-sprint-deal-would-extend-seattle-areas-long-wireless-reign/"> Seattle Times’ infographic on Bellevue’s wireless company history</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9d-H0tfHtE">John Legere at CES 2013</a></li></ul><p>Carve Outs:</p><ul><li>Ben: <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/andrew-chen-on-growth/">Andrew Chen on the Intercom podcast</a></li><li>David: The <a href="https://996.ggvc.com/category/podcast/">996 Podcast</a> from Zara &amp; Hans at GGV Capital</li></ul>
