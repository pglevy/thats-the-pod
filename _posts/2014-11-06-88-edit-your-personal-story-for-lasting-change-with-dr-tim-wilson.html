<p>Do you feel stuck in behaviors or mindsets that hold you back from the man you want to be? In today's podcast we're going to introduce you to a technique scientifically proven to help bring lasting change in people's lives. It's called &quot;story editing&quot; and our guest today wrote a book on the subject. His name is Dr. Tim Wilson and he's the author of the book, Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change. Tim and I discuss how we can edit our stories to become better men and what George Bailey can teach us about changing our story.</p>
