<p>I talk to the founder and CEO of Onnit Aubrey Marcus about what it means to strive for &quot;total human optimization.&quot; We discuss cognitive boosters like nootropics, why we should look to the past for fitness inspiration, and what he's learned about masculinity working with the top MMA fighters in the world. Plus much more.</p>
