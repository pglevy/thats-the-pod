<p>Ben &amp; David are joined by special guest and Venmo cofounder Andrew Kortina for our first-ever SF live show! In front of a packed house we chronicle the journey of how two freshman-year roommates from Penn turned a healthy obsession with Craigslist and a fake podcast into an app that facilitated $17B of payments last quarter alone, producing not one but two landmark acquisitions along the way!</p><p>Note: the audio quality is a little rough due to some A/V issues at the live show. We apologize!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Carve Outs:</p><ul><li>Kortina: <a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/msysip.htm">The Myth Of Sisyphus</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a></li><li>David: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L0M749M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"> Startup</a> by Jerry Kaplan</li><li>Ben: <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c"> Halide on the new iPhone XS camera and computational photography</a></li></ul>
