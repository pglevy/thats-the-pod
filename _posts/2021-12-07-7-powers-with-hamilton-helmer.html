<p>You've heard us talk <em>about</em> him every episode for the past two years... but until now most of you have never actually heard us talk <em>to</em> him! To celebrate the LP Show going public, we've remastered our first, canonical interview with Hamilton Helmer, originally released as an LP episode in March 2020. Hamilton’s 7 Powers framework gives a deep, academic investigation to the question, “what creates an enduring company?” This episode is an absolute must-listen for anyone working or investing in tech (and beyond), and we're so excited to finally make it available to everyone.</p><p>And if you want more episodes like this, we have good news... <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">all back catalog LP Show episodes are now free</a> and available to anyone! You can <a href="http://pod.link/acquiredlp">follow our new public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice. It's already chock-full of 60+ great episodes like our VC Fundamentals series, interviews with founders of top early-stage startups, and master classes on pricing, marketplaces, SaaS investing and many more topics. Happy listening and happy holidays to everyone!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy/dp/0998116319"> 7 Powers on Amazon</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><em> ‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
