<p>In creating the Jack Reacher character, Lee Child launched a series of books that now boast 100 million copies in print and have been turned into movies and a popular Amazon streaming series.</p><p>Today on the show, I talk to Lee about what makes Reacher so compelling and much more. We first discuss how Lee didn't get started with writing until he was almost forty, and what prompted him to change careers. We then unpack the Reacher character, discussing the ancient, archetypal roots of this vigilante, drifter detective, what he has in common with the knight errant, and the enduring appeal of the lone wolf. We also talk about Lee's writing process, why midlife is the best time to write, and why, after writing more than two dozen Reacher novels, he's chosen to hand off the series to his brother and fellow writer, Andrew.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="http://in%20too%20deep/" target="_blank">The latest Reacher novel: <i>In Too Deep</i></a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3zS3XSu" target="_blank">The <i>Reacher</i> streaming series </a></li><li><a href="https://www.jackreacher.com/us/">Jack Reacher website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/10/41oXDdn3pkL._SY445_SX342_.jpg" alt="Book cover of "In Too Deep" by Lee Child and Andrew Child, featuring a burning building against a blue and purple forest backdrop, evoking the intense drama familiar to Jack Reacher fans." /><h2> </h2>
