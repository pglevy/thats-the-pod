<p>Our guest on the podcast today is Chris Mamula. Chris blogs on the website, "<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/" target="_blank">Can I Retire Yet?</a>" and he has also cowritten a book called <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/book/" target="_blank"><i>Choose FI: Your Blueprint to Financial Independence</i></a>, which was published in 2019. Chris is loosely part of the FIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early, movement, but he brings a fresh perspective to the concept. He retired from a career as a physical therapist at age 41. After poor experiences with the financial industry early in his professional life, he educated himself on investing and tax planning. Now he draws on his experience to write about wealth building, do-it-yourself investing, financial planning, early retirement, and lifestyle design.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/" target="_blank">Can I Retire Yet?</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.choosefi.com/book/" target="_blank">Choose FI: Your Blueprint to Financial Independence</a>, by Chris Mamula, Brad Barrett, and Jonathan Mendonsa. <br /><br /><strong>FIRE Movement</strong><br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement" target="_blank">FIRE Movement</a><br /><br />"<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/style/what-is-fire-financial-independence-retire-early.html" target="_blank">Your Questions about FIRE, Answered</a>," by Steven Kurutz<i>, The New York Times</i>, Sept. 11, 2018. <br /><br /><strong>Lifestyle and Personal Considerations</strong></p><p> </p><p>"<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nearly-2-years-into-early-retirement-heres-all-that-ive-gotten-wrong-2019-08-19" target="_blank">Nearly 2 Years into Early Retirement, Here’s All That I’ve Gotten Wrong</a>," by Chris Mamula, marketwatch.com, Aug. 19, 2019.  <br /><br />“<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/a-strong-marriage-in-retirement/" target="_blank">A Strong Marriage in Retirement</a>,” by Darrow Kirkpatrick, Can I Retire Yet?, March 19, 2017. <br /><br />"<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/fire-make-life-harder/" target="_blank">Does Fire Make Life Harder</a><a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/fire-make-life-harder/">?</a>," by Chris Mamula, Can I Retire Yet?, Dec. 10, 2018. <br /><br />“<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/week-life-fire-household/" target="_blank">A Week in the Life of a Fire Household</a>,” by Chris Mamula, Can I Retire Yet?, Sept. 17, 2018. <br /><br /><strong>Healthcare Coverage for Early Retirees</strong><br /><br />“<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/aca-subsidies-affordable-health-insurance/" target="_blank">Navigating ACA Tax Credits to Purchase Affordable Health Insurance</a>,” by Chris Mamula, Can I Retire Yet?, Nov. 12, 2018.</p><p><br /> </p><p> </p><p>“<a href="https://obliviousinvestor.com/how-to-qualify-for-affordable-care-act-obamacare-premium-subsidies/" target="_blank">How to Qualify for Affordable Care Act (‘Obamacare’) Premium Subsidies</a>,” by Mike Piper, Oblivious Investor.</p><p><br /> </p><p> </p><p>“<a href="https://www.caniretireyet.com/health-care-sharing-ministries-early-retirement/" target="_blank">Are Health Care Sharing Ministries a Viable Alternative to Health Insurance for Early Retirement?</a>” by Chris Mamula, Can I Retire Yet?, Nov. 19, 2018.</p><p><br /> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_sharing_ministry" target="_blank">Health care sharing ministry</a>, Wikipedia. <br /><br />“<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/04/early-retirement-how-afford-health-insurance/1333554001/" target="_blank">Do You Plan to Retire by 50?
