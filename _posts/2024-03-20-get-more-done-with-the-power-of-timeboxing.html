<p>From work to chores to entertaining distractions, there are many options for what you can be doing at any moment in the modern world. We often endlessly toggle between these options and, as a result, feel frazzled and frustratingly unproductive. We feel ever haunted by the question, "What should I be doing right now?" (Or "What am I even doing right now?")</p><p>My guest will share a simple but effective productivity method that will quash this feeling of overwhelm, answer that question, and help you make much better use of your time. Marc Zao-Sanders is the CEO and co-founder of filtered.com, a learning tech company, and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/4a1dIKH"><i>Timeboxing: The Power of Doing One Thing at a Time</i></a>. In the first half of our conversation, we unpack what timeboxing — which brings your calendar and to-do list together — is all about and its benefits as a time management system, including how it can help you get more done, live with greater intention and freedom, and even create a log of memories. In the second half of our conversation, we get into the practicalities of timeboxing, from how to capture the to-dos that will go on your calendar to how to deal with things that might pull you away from it. We end our conversation with how you can get started with timeboxing right now and have a more focused, productive, and satisfying day tomorrow.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-543-learn-the-system-for-getting-things-done/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #543: Learn the System for Getting Things Done With David Allen</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/slow-productivity-cal-newport/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #972: Down With Pseudo-Productivity — Why We Need to Transform the Way We Work With Cal Newport</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/eisenhower-decision-matrix/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Eisenhower Decision Matrix — How to Distinguish Between Urgent and Important Tasks and Make Real Progress in Your Life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/monotasking-podcast/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #768: Become a Focused Monotasker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/todoist-productivity-tips/" target="_blank">AoM Article: The Productivity Tool I Use to Get Things Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/a-formula-for-success-the-power-of-implementation-intentions/" target="_blank">AoM Article: A Formula for Success — The Power of Implementation Intentions</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Marc Zao-Sanders</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://marczaosanders.com/" target="_blank">Marc's website</a></li><li><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/marczaosanders" target="_blank">Marc on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/03/717czXZR03L._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" /><h2> </h2>
