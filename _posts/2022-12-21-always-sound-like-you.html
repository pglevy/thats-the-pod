<p>A small business has many benefits, like being able to move quickly, stay flexible and pivot when needed, something big businesses can&apos;t do as easily. </p><p> </p><p>But, with the lure of getting bigger, sometimes small businesses fall into the trap of getting caught up in stiff language and legalese and ending up not sounding like themselves. </p><p> </p><p>Today, the cofounders of 37signals, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, discuss why small businesses should embrace the fact they can communicate without running every word through a legal or public relations department, as discussed in the chapter &quot;Sound Like You&quot; of their book, <a href='https://37signals.com/books/'><em>Rework</em></a>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:54] - Jason shares why they usually publish their writing directly — from mind to keyboard to the world—to get their ideas out there as clearly, and quickly as possible.  </p><p>[02:00] - Why running something you&apos;ve written through a filter often produces something that sounds like legalese. </p><p>[03:00] - David shares why writing what you want to read is vital (or don&apos;t share).</p><p>[05:49] - Big company writing philosophy is often to ensure that your writing says as little as possible but reaches as many people as possible. It&apos;s why all big companies sound the same.</p><p>[07:01] - David shares why you have to create your own interest by simply being interesting, by sharing something novel, of having a stand and a position on something in some regard that&apos;s also not just there. </p><p>[07:52] - The smaller your company, the bigger risk you can (and should) take with your writing.  </p><p>[09:05] - Jason shares some dos (and don&apos;ts) for writing for your small business.   </p><p>[12:12] - David explains why developing your writing voice is essential and how you can do it in relative obscurity if you are a small company.</p><p>[14:49] - How to become an overnight writing sensation (after just ten years of practice).</p><p>[15:38] - When you SHOULD go through legal and PR before publishing your writing. </p><p>[18:35] - &quot;We have expertise in authentically stating our observations and opinions about the business world, how to run a company, and how to develop good software—so that&apos;s what we do.&quot;</p><p>[19:22] - &quot;Everything is interesting if you peel back the layers far enough.&quot;</p><p>[20:20] - Why it&apos;s essential to measure your writing for the internet as a body of work, not on a piece-by-piece basis. </p><p>[22:03] - The unobtainable formula for creating a hit. </p><p>[22:57] - The no-traction way to gain traction with your writing. </p><p>[23:42] - Why you should avoid looking at the stats of how many people are reading your writing. </p><p>[25:25] - If you have a specific question for Jason or David, leave us a voicemail at 708-628-7850, and we might answer it on an upcoming show.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Links and Resources:<br/></strong><br/>Do you have a question for Jason and David?
