<p>Throughout each day, all of us make little shifts in our roles and responsibilities; we take off one hat and put on another. Sometimes these shifts are physical, as when we commute from home to the office. Other times, the shifts are mental, as when we finish working on an administrative task and start working on a creative one.</p><p>My guest calls these little shifts “microtransitions” and says that mastering them is a significant key in living a happy, fulfilled, and successful life. His name is Dr. Adam Fraser and he’s a peak performance researcher and the author of <a href="https://dradamfraser.com/shop-content/the-third-space"><i>The Third Space</i></a>. As Adam explains, in each microtransition, there are three spaces: the first space which is the task, role, or place you’re leaving behind, the second space, which is the task, role, or place you’re transitioning to, and the third space which is the in-between transition itself. To make an ideal microtransition, you break that third space into three phases, and Adam walks us through how to execute each one so you can show up as your best self in the second space. We talk about how to make microtransitions between different work roles, and spend a lot of our conversation on how to improve the microtransiton between work and home — even if you work from home — so you can arrive ready to engage with your partner or family.</p><h2><strong>Resources Related to the Podcast</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/sunday-firesides-your-routine-needs-rites-of-passage/">Sunday Firesides: Your Routine Needs Rites of Passage</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/take-a-homeric-bath/">AoM article on how to use a “Homeric bath” as a transitional “homecoming” ritual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/alexander-graham-bells-location-based-prompt-method-can-make-productive/">AoM article on how Alexander Graham Bell used “locational prompts” to be more productive</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/a-place-for-everything-including-certain-kinds-of-work/">AoM article on doing different kinds of work in different places</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/family/sunday-firesides-give-them-the-cream/">Sunday Firesides: Give Them the Cream</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Adam Fraser</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://dradamfraser.com/" target="_blank">Adam’s Website</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2023/07/71fBkddRktL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" width="350" />
