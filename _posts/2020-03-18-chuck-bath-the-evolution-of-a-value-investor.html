<p><i>Editor's Note: The following interview with Chuck Bath, comanager of Diamond Hill Large Cap, was recorded on March 4, 2020. As such, it doesn't incorporate recent market volatility, and the manager's views and positions may have changed since the recording.</i></p><p>Our guest on the podcast is Chuck Bath, a portfolio manager who has logged a tremendous record over nearly 40 years. Since 2002, Bath has been manager of Diamond Hill Large Cap, a $6 billion fund that earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold. He is assistant portfolio manager for Bronze-rated Diamond Hill Long-Short.</p><p>Prior to joining Diamond Hill, he steered Nationwide Fund to outstanding returns during 17 years at the helm.
