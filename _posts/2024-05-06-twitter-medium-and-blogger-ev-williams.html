<p>As co-founder of Twitter and founder of Blogger and Medium, Evan Williams literally helped change the conversation: he understood that real-time connectivity—being able to write a post and have people read it seconds later—was the future of engagement online.&nbsp;A Nebraska farm boy who dropped out of college, Ev ran into several business failures before starting Blogger, and—after it sold to Google—launching Twitter with Jack Dorsey and others.&nbsp;Ev also came to learn that he understood product better than people, a trait that would contribute to his eventual ouster as Twitter CEO.&nbsp;After that crushing blow, he returned to his first love by starting Medium, a blogging site for posts that are neither too short or too long.</p><p>This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Neva Grant.
