<p>I talk to author Kenneth W. Royce about his new book Modules For Manhood. Kenneth and I discuss how the famous gunfighter Jeff Cooper inspired this book; the skills every young man should have before leaving his parents home; why manhood is lacking today; what young men can do today to start down the path of manhood;  and what parents can do to help their sons.</p>
