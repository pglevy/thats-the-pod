<p>Are leaders born or made? Judging by the 50 billion dollar leadership development industry, the answer is definitely the latter. From schools to workplaces, everyone is seen as a potential leader and expected to become one by undergoing leadership training.</p><p>My guest questions the assumptions underlying this phenomenon, which he calls "the leadership industrial complex," and says that the cult of leadership, and its idea that everyone can and should become a leader, can create burnout and unhappiness.</p><p>Elias Aboujaoude is a Stanford professor of psychiatry and the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/402v9IN"><i>A Leader's Destiny: Why Psychology, Personality, and Character Make All the Difference</i></a>. Today on the show, Elias describes the state of the leadership industrial complex, the mathematical impossibility it forwards that everyone can be a leader and no one is a follower, and the primary presumption it makes that leadership can be taught. Elias argues that, in fact, a lot of what makes for good leadership is innate and potentially unchangeable. We discuss the implications of this fact, and why it's actually okay not to want to be a leader.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-838-can-virtue-be-taught/" target="_blank">AoM Podcast #838: Can Virtue Be Taught?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/leadership/dont-just-lead-well-follow-well/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Don’t Just Lead Well, Follow Well</a></li><li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/are-you-a-strategist-or-an-operator/" target="_blank">AoM Article: Are You a Strategist or an Operator? </a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Elias Aboujaoude</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.eliasaboujaoude.com/" target="_blank">Elias' website</a></li><li><a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/elias-aboujaoude" target="_blank">Elias' Stanford profile page</a></li></ul><img src="https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2024/10/7147NcqcksL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="" />
