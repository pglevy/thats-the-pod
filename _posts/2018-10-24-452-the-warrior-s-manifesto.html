<p>"Warrior" is a word that gets thrown around a lot. There are road warriors, and social justice warriors, and ninja warriors. But what does it really mean to be a warrior?</p><p>My guest today sets out a working definition in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MKJDNS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B078MKJDNS&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4" target="_blank"><em>The Warrior’s Manifesto</em></a><em>.</em> His name is Daniel Modell, and he earned his Master's Degree in philosophy before going on to serve for twenty years in the New York City Police Department.</p><p>Daniel and I begin our conversation discussing what makes a warrior and the lessons Spartacus can teach us on that score. Daniel and I then discuss why warriors do what they do, why violence is sometimes necessary for peace, and what it means to be savage without becoming savage. We then discuss how bureaucracy kills leadership and why you don’t need a title to be a leader. At the end of our conversation, Daniel talks about why it isn't just members of the military and law enforcement who need to understand the way of the warrior, but ordinary civilians as well.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href="http://aom.is/warriorsmanifesto" target="_blank">aom.is/warriorsmanifesto</a>.</p>
