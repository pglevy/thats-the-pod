<p>This week, Guy is joined by Leah Solivan of TaskRabbit, Scott and Ally Svenson of MOD Pizza, and Holly Thaggard of Supergoop! to answer questions about reaching new customers from three early-stage founders in this special “mashup” episode of the How I Built This Lab Advice Line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, Erin from Alameda, California wants to introduce users to an online divorce platform so the legal process isn’t any harder than it has to be. Then, Kaveh in San Diego seeks to bring his olive oil beyond the farmers market and into kitchens nationwide. And finally, Erik from New Jersey offers on-the-go medical kits to make travel prep that much easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to the founders of Hello Divorce, aficio22 and JetSet Meds for being a part of our show.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one-minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered. Send a voice memo to hibt@id.wondery.com or call 1-800-433-1298.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To hear our guests’ previous episodes:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-taskrabbit-leah-solivan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TaskRabbit: Leah Solivan</a> | <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-advice-line-with-leah-solivan-of-taskrabbit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advice Line with Leah Solivan</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-mod-pizza-amp-seattle-coffee-company-scott-and-ally-svenson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MOD Pizza &amp; Seattle Coffee Company: Scott and Ally Svenson</a> | <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-advice-line-with-scott-and-ally-svenson-of-mod-pizza" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advice Line with Scott and Ally Svenson</a> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-supergoop-holly-thaggard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supergoop!: Holly Thaggard</a> | <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-advice-line-with-holly-thaggard-of-supergoop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Advice Line with Holly Thaggard</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
