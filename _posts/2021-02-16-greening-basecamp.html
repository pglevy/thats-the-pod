<p>Basecamp recently set out to do a carbon accounting, looking at the company&apos;s emissions, as well as meaningful ways to offset and mitigate those impacts. Jane Yang and Elizabeth Gramm, the two Basecampers who took on this daunting and nuanced project, come on the show to discuss not just the work itself, but how they&apos;ve been processing the fear, skepticism, grief, and hope that come with trying to address the climate crisis.</p><p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p>The <a href='https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf'>United Nations 2018 special report</a> on global warming of 1.5ÂºC (PDF) - 1:52</p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRqh8oLY7Ik'>&quot;Why Air Quality Matters,&quot;</a> David Heinemeier Hansson&apos;s presentation to the company about indoor air quality - 2:26</p><p><a href='https://bookshop.org/books/the-uninhabitable-earth-life-after-warming/9780525576716?aid=19'>The Uninhabitable Earth</a> by David Wallace-Wells - 4:01</p><p><a href='https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenhouse-gases-epa'>Explainer</a> on Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions - 5:46</p><p><a href='https://basecamp.com/about/office'>Basecamp&apos;s former office</a> in Chicago - 6:22</p><p><a href='https://rework.fm/spending-in-the-clouds/'>&quot;Spending in the Clouds,&quot;</a> our episode about looking for savings on Basecamp&apos;s cloud services - 6:59</p><p><a href='https://basecamp.com/books'>Books by Basecamp</a> - 10:18</p><p><a href='https://m.signalvnoise.com/towards-carbon-negativity/'>&quot;Towards carbon negativity,&quot;</a> Jane&apos;s first post about the project on Signal v.
