Or maybe, like me, you feel even worse about the art you've been making lately? This past year has brought a few blows to my professional and personal creativity, and at the end of 2023, I was feeling pretty crappy about my own work. I've come to this point many times in my career, and usually I just shrug it off and keep going. But this time was different. In this episode I talk about how I was able to climb out of a hole of artistic despair and rekindle my love affair with my work. By listening to this episode, I hope you will learn how to rediscover the joy in your own practice. If it hasn't happened to you yet â€” listen to this one and put it in your back pocket. ðŸ˜‰</p><p>Listen all the way to the end, where I share some additional thoughts on the connection between our process and reclaiming our joy amidst our concerns of Artificial Intelligence taking over our jobs.</p><p>Â </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 â€” Share this episode/podcast with a friend.Â </strong><br />This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 â€” Support me on Patreon at http://</strong><a href="https://dashboard.simplecast.com/accounts/a12847e1-20ae-4adb-8733-fabad1224e58/shows/91340d9b-06be-46bf-84d4-d7143d6e2b24/episodes/cd39b75a-9f43-4fd5-9229-d88818989484/patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a><br />This helps me cover some of the costs of running the show.</p><p><strong>03 â€“ Take my Skillshare classes!Â </strong><br />Visit http://<a href="https://thoughts-on-illustration.simplecast.com/tomfroese.com/teaching">tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
