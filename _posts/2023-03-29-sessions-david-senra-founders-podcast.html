<p>ACQ Sessions returns with David Senra of the Founders Podcast. David is one of our very favorite people in the world — it’s impossible to spend an hour (or 3!) with him and not come away inspired to go take over the world. This conversation is an “extended, IRL version” of monthly calls that we do together where we share stories, swap life and podcast advice, and just genuinely enjoy sharing time with someone who shares our outlook and enthusiasm for the history of entrepreneurship. Pull up a chair, grab a beverage (or energy drink in David’s case) and join us!</p><p><strong>ACQ2 Show:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://pod.link/acquiredlp">Subscribe to the shiny new ACQ2!</a></li></ul><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://pod.link/founders">Go subscribe to Founders!</a> Some of our favorite episodes: <a href="https://pod.link/founders/episode/820a5119b72b76b210df24e7a4a8e1bf">Bernard Arnault</a>, <a href="https://pod.link/founders/episode/41a47a7535026098511ae2c16ff22804">Brunello Cucinelli</a>, <a href="https://pod.link/founders/episode/b5637cb4b83ff459da8d05d804cf636f">Edwin Land</a>, <a href="https://pod.link/founders/episode/bda7f5dbc148b894f7ba4ad494e45460">Kobe Bryant</a></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><p><strong>Topics:<br></strong><br><em>Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
