<p>In this episode, we start looking into the topic of feedback, as in getting feedback on our illustrations or artwork. What kind of feedback should we be seeking, and where should we look? It turns out that we don't always need critique — sometimes we just need to know we're on the right track. Sometimes we don't want solutions, we want comfort. This episode begins with some reflections on what it means to seek comfort — that is, positive affirmation about our work.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>My team and I work hard to produce each episode for this podcast.
