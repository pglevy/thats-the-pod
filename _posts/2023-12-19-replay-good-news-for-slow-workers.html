Whether you're listening for the first time or you're hearing it again, I truly believe it's worth hearing this message.</strong></p><p>Do you ever feel like everything takes YOU longer than everyone else? In this episode,  talk about what it’s been like for me as a slow worker. What kinds of things have slowed me down, and how have I been able to thrive as a successful illustrator in spite of them. So if you’re a slowpoke trying to figure out why it just takes so long to get things done, this one is for you.</p><p>I’m going talk about why I think there are two kinds of slow — good slow and bad slow — and why we should embrace the former and try to change the latter. And of course, I’ll give you some ways to do both. How can you embrace the things about your work that you maybe wish would go faster, and how you can change some of the things that truly get in your creative way.</p><p>By the end of this episode, I hope that you’ll feel permitted to give yourself the time you need to do your best work — and to defend that time when it comes under question by yourself — or by others.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend.</strong></p><p>This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at </strong><a href="http://patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>http://patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a></p><ul><li>$8 Drawing Buddies gain exclusive access to my monthly Draw With Me meetups.</li><li>Join for as low as $3 to get 20% off my 1-on-1 coaching sessions</li></ul><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes!</strong></p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.tomfroese.com/teaching">http://tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
