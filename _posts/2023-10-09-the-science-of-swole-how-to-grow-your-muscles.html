<p>A lot of guys would like to build bigger muscles. And they may have heard that in order to do so, they need to activate something called "hypertrophy." But what is hypertrophy and how do you achieve it in order to get swole?</p><p>My guest, bodybuilding and strength coach Paul Carter, will unpack what you need to know today on the show. We get into the difference between size and strength, the two big myths around hypertrophy, the right number of sets to do for developing a muscle group, why Paul thinks machines are better than free weights for building bigger muscles, and more.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3LNdBZ8" target="_blank"><i>Maximum Muscle Bible </i>by Christian Thibaudeau and Paul Carter</a></li><li><a href="https://thebarbell.com/mike-mentzer-workout/" target="_blank">Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty training</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Paul Carter</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/liftrunbang/?hl=en" target="_blank">Paul on IG</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LiftRunBang/" target="_blank">Paul on FB</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.trainheroic.com/brand/Lift%20Run%20Bang">Paul's Programming at Train Heroic</a></li></ul>
