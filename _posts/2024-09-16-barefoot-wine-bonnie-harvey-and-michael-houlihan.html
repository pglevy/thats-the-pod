<p>Bonnie Harvey and Michael Houlihan started Barefoot Wine with $300,000 in debt and almost no knowledge of wine. What they did understand was how to sell it—with a carefree name and label that evoked the beach, and a consistent flavor and low price point that attracted shoppers who normally rejected wine as being too snooty.&nbsp;But winning over that audience took extreme patience, and years of pavement-pounding by Michael. In 2005—twenty years after launch—Barefoot had become ubiquitous, and was acquired by E &amp; J Gallo, one of the biggest wine brands in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This episode was produced by J.C.
