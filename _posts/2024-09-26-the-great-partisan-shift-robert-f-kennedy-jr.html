<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discuss the development of Donald Trump’s political team, how the team plans to tackle foreign affairs and the ongoing health crisis, Kamala Harris’ inability to unify the country (let alone police the broader world), and the detrimental metamorphosis of the Democratic Party which has left it scrambling and scheming for a shot at the presidency, despite the clear will of the people.</p><p> </p><p>This episode was filmed on September 18th, 2024</p><p> </p><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a writer, attorney, activist, and politician who has had a career-spanning focus on clean water, environmental, and public health issues. RFK Jr. is the founder of the WaterKeeper Alliance — the world’s largest clean water advocacy group — and has served as its longtime chairman and attorney. In this role, he spearheaded the New York City Watershed Agreement, which has come to be considered an international model for sustainable development and stakeholder consensus negotiation. RFK Jr. was named Time Magazine’s “Hero for the Planet” for his efforts to restore the Hudson River, which along with other achievements has led to more than 300 WaterKeeper organizations taking root across the globe. As nephew of the United States' beloved 35th president, he has dutifully earned his own acclaim across decades of formative work.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Robert F.
