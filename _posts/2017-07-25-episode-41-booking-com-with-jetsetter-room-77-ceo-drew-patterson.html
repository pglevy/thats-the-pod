<p>Acquired trains its lens on the “second or third best acquisition of all-time”, Priceline’s 2005 purchase of Booking.com. Our heroes are joined by friend-of-the-show and former Jetsetter &amp; Room 77 CEO Drew Patterson to help understand how this little-known startup from The Netherlands grew into the largest travel company in the world, with nearly $8B in annual revenue. Was this deal even better than Instagram??? We debate, hotly.   <br></p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong><br>Pilot: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24">https://bit.ly/acquiredpilot24</a><br>Statsig: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24">https://bit.ly/acquiredstatsig24</a><br>Crusoe: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe">https://bit.ly/acquiredcrusoe</a></p><br>Topics covered include: <ul><li>The biggest startup you’ve never heard of (in the US), <a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a>, and its parent company Priceline (yes, the William Shatner Priceline)</li><li>Booking’s founding in Amsterdam in late 1996: by recent college graduate Geert-Jan Bruinsma</li><li>Skift.com’s <a href="https://skift.com/history-of-online-travel/">Definitive Oral History of Online Travel </a></li><li>The travel industry's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system">GDS's (“Global Distribution Systems”)</a> and the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(computer_system)">Sabre</a> </li><li>How Bruinsma raised the initial money for Booking: by emailing anyone he know who had an email address </li><li>OTAs ("Online Travel Agencies”) and how they operate; the "merchant model" versus the “agency model"</li><li>The role of search in online travel </li><li>Bill Gurley on <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2013/10/02/conversion-the-most-important-internet-metric-of-all-revisited/"> Conversion: The Most Important Internet Metric of All</a></li><li>Expedia’s early flirtation with Booking, and decision not to acquire the company</li><li>Priceline head of M&amp;A Glenn Fogel’s vision for how powerful the agency model for OTAs could become in Europe</li><li>Priceline and Glenn's 2004 acquisition of Active Hotels in the UK, followed by the 2005 acquisition of Booking for $133M and the combination of the two businesses into <a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a> </li><li>Booking’s incredible growth in the decade since the acquisition, from less than 20M room-nights to over 500M, and $7.8B in revenue in 2016</li></ul><p>  The Carve Out: </p><ul><li>Ben: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjR2vegUBAo">Scott Forstall talking about the original iPhone at the Computer History Museum</a></li><li>David: <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_sick/">The Big Sick</a></li><li>Drew: Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/topics/money-stuff">Money Stuff by Matt Levine</a></li></ul>
