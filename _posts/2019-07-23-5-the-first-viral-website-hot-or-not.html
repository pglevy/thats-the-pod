James Hong (@jhong) is the creator of Hot or Not? He sits down to tell us how the silly website went from 42 friends, to 2 million page views per day within a week. I love his philosophy of running it like an "internet laundromat" - collecting nickels & quarters from the machine (up to $20,000 per night!) Great guy, great energy, checkout the episode. - shaan (@shaanvp on twitter)Â
