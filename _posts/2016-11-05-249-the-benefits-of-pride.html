<p>Pride. It’s been called one of the deadly sins.<br />But what if pride holds the key to human success and flourishing?<br />Well, that’s the argument my guest makes in her book, &quot;Take Pride.&quot; Her name is Jessica Tracy, and she's a psychologist at the University of British Columbia.

We also discuss how men and women experience and express pride differently.</p>
