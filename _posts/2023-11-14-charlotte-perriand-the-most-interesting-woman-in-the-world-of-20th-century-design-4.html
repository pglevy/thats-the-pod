<p>Charlotte Perriand is the most interesting woman in the world of 20th century design. Her life story reads like a spy adventure novel.</p><p>She helped pioneer the Modernist movement in architecture and interior design; she escaped France as the Germans were invading — on a ship bound for Japan; she hid in an attic with her baby from murderous revolutionaries in Vietnam, avoiding almost certain death; she hiked and skied and built portable shelters in the Alps; she visited her husband in Rio and traveled to exotic locations like Tahiti and the Windward Islands, before they were polluted by tourism; And she designed and oversaw construction of one of the premiere French ski resort destinations.</p><p>Through it all, she exhibited a zest for life and a desire to combine technology with arts and crafts to improve people’s lives around the world. Paraphrasing Henry David Thoreau, she exemplified his motto that before you sit down to create, you have to stand up and live life. Her life of creation — the title of her autobiography — was a life of exhilarating experience. It was also a life of wrestling with contradictions: reconciling global modernism with traditional regionalism, technological progress with preservation of culture, and socialist ideals with the totalitarian realities of the 20th century.</p><p>In this episode, we’ll explore these themes in Perriand’s own words and reflect on what it might mean for us as designers today.</p><p>Outline</p><p>* Irony of modernism (1:30)</p><p>* Irony of collectivism (25:42)</p><p>* Perriand’s move away from modernism (37:36)</p><p>* Irony of progress (51:39)</p><p>* Her philosophy (59:59)</p><p>* Parting thoughts (1:06:43)</p><p>References</p><p>* <em>Charlotte Perriand: A Life of Creation</em> by Charlotte Perriand (Goodreads)</p><p>* <em>Modern Architecture: A Critical History</em> by Kenneth Frampton (Goodreads)</p><p>* <em>Towards a New Architecture</em> by Le Corbusier (Goodreads)</p><p>* <em>A Guide To The World’s Greatest Buildings — Masterpieces of Architecture & Engineering</em> edited by Trevor Howells (Goodreads)</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://skyrisecities.com/news/2016/01/inside-le-corbusiers-brutalist-radiant-city.19158">Inside Le Corbusier's Brutalist Radiant City</a> (SkyriseCities)</p><p>* <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_67#/media/File:Habitat_panorama.jpg">Habitat 67 as seen from Montreal’s port</a> (Wikipedia)</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
