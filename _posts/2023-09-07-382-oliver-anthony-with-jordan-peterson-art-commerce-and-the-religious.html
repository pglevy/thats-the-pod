<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and breakout musician Chris Lunsford, better known by his stage name Oliver Anthony, discuss the balance between vision and efficiency in artistic and commercial endeavors, why Chris’ hit song “Rich Men North of Richmond,” has resonated so broadly and so quickly, the way honest expression through music can combat demoralization, how politics have become confused with the sacred, and what we can do to restore each to their proper order.</p><p> </p><p>Oliver Anthony, real name Christopher Anthony Lunsford, is an American country/folk musician from Farmville, Virginia. He just recently went viral for his anthem song, “Rich Men North of Richmond” – which has resonated across the country for its messaging about Washington D.C. and the state of poverty and mental health in the broader U.S.. Chris has stated his politics as being right down or near the center, though already tribalism has attempted to take hold of or alternatively reduce/dismiss him, all the while “Rich Men” has amassed nearly 60 million views on YT in just over a month, and trended the billboard charts (Hitting number one more than once) since its release. Chris named his YT channel Oliver Anthony Music after his grandfather, whom he has described as a “real 1930’s Appalachian man.” Since his song's virality, he has already been offered – and turned down – an 8 million dollar recording contract, and is making waves as a truly authentic artist both in performance and practice.</p><p> </p><p>- Links -</p><p> </p><p>For Oliver Anthony:</p><p> </p><p>Oliver Anthony Music (Website) https://oliveranthonymusic.com/</p><p> </p><p>Oliver Anthony Music (YouTube) https://www.youtube.com/@oliveranthonymusic</p><p> </p><p>“Rich Men North of Richmond” original release https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro</p><p> </p>
