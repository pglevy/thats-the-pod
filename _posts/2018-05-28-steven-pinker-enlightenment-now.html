<p>I spoke with Harvard's Dr. Steven Pinker about the immense improvements in human living conditions that are now happening with amazing speed almost everywhere in the world -- as detailed in his new book, Enlightenment Now! (https://amzn.to/2jDwv7D) -- a careful, clear-headed and data-driven defense of the rational/scientific worldview that helped make such improvement possible). Dr. Pinker grew up in Montreal and earned his BA from McGill and his PhD from Harvard. </p><p> </p>
