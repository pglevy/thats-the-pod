<p>Lecture 14 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories lecture series. This lecture closes 2017, and the book of Genesis. In it, I present the story of Joseph who, as the wearer of the coat of many colors, is profoundly adaptable, courageous, adaptable, merciful and just. Even in slavery -- even in prison -- he comes out triumphant, because of the strength of his character and his wisdom. </p><p> </p>
