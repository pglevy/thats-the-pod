Our teacher today is Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital. Brad is an exceptional investor and gifted teacher with a unique ability to distill complex ideas into clear, qualitative insights.
In this session, Brad will share lessons learned across the full arc of his career that has spanned everything from RV manufacturing to politics to founding and operating several technology companies to building Altimeter into one of the preeminent technology investors across all stages, public and private.
We also discuss Invest America, a bipartisan grassroots movement led by Brad to make every child in the US a saver and investor beginning the day they are born. We're delighted to bring this class to you in collaboration with Notre Dame professor Jim Sullivan, co-founder of the Lab for Economic Opportunity, and inaugural chair of the Notre Dame Poverty Initiative.
Please enjoy our class with the wonderful Brad Gerstner.
