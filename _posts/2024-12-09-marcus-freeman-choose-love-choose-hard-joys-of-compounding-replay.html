In honor of Notre Dame clinching a playoff spot, we're replaying our conversation from earlier this year with head coach Marcus Freeman. We discuss the power of relationships and how he talks with his players about the concepts of hard work & love. Marcus delves into what it takes to focus on inputs rather than outputs, especially as the college sports world is changing in unprecedented ways. 
And for you football fans out there, we even get into a little bit of what's ahead for Notre Dame’s program in Marcus’s third year as head coach. As alums and lifelong fans of the Irish, it was a real treat to host Coach Freeman at our studios. Please enjoy this class with Coach Marcus Freeman.
