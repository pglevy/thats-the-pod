Webster. Kyle is the guy behind the many, many digital illustration brushes (2,400 and counting) that come bundled with Adobe Photoshop and Fresco. In this episode we talk about his beginnings as an aspiring illustrator many years ago, and how he slowly but steadily built up a small empire around his digital brushes — which have no doubt shaped the world of digital illustration as we know it today. We have a wide ranging conversation that touches on things like:</p><ul><li>Building up an illustration portfolio when you haven't had any clients yet</li><li>Why working in different styles can make good business sense</li><li>What Kyle means when he calls himself an Accidental Expert</li><li>What Kyle finds most meaningful in his work and career, besides drawing or making brushes</li><li>Why making Creativity a way of life is necessary to building up a successful career</li><li>And much, much more!</li></ul><p><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening/watching!</p><p><strong>01 — Share this episode/podcast with a friend.</strong></p><p>This is the single most effective way to help grow this podcast.</p><p><strong>02 — Support me on Patreon at </strong><a href="http://patreon.com/tomfroese"><strong>http://patreon.com/tomfroese</strong></a></p><ul><li>$8 Drawing Buddies gain exclusive access to my monthly Draw With Me meetups.</li><li>Join for as low as $3 to get 20% off my 1-on-1 coaching sessions</li></ul><p><strong>03 – Take my Skillshare classes!</strong></p><ul><li>Visit <a href="http://www.tomfroese.com/teaching">http://tomfroese.com/teaching</a> to find links to all my classes.
