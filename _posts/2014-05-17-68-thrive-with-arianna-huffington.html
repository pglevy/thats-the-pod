<p>Today I talk to Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post and author of the book Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder. Arianna and I discuss our culture's glorification of sleeplessness, power, and money and the ill effects its having on us as individuals and as a society.</p>
